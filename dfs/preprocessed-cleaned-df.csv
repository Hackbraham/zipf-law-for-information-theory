"['\n Even if it is true that we routinely rely on abductive reasoning, it may still be asked whether this practice is rational. For instance, experimental studies have shown that when people are able to think of an explanation for some possible event, they tend to overestimate the likelihood that this event will actually occur.  More telling still, Lombrozo  shows that, in some situations, people tend to grossly overrate the probability of simpler explanations compared to more complicated ones. Although these studies are not directly concerned with abduction in any of the forms discussed so far, they nevertheless suggest that taking into account explanatory considerations in one’s reasoning may not always be for the better. (It is to be noted that Lombrozo’s experiments are directly concerned with some proposals that have been made for explicating abduction in a Bayesian framework; see Section 4.) However, the most pertinent remarks about the normative status of abduction are so far to be found in the philosophical literature. This section discusses the main criticisms that have been levelled against abduction, as well as the strongest arguments that have been given in its defense.']";Ah, excellent question! The critics of abduction, like some of the authors mentioned in this text, argue that our reliance on explanatory considerations can lead to errors and biases. However, proponents of abduction would counter that it's still a valuable tool, as long as we're aware of its limitations. It's like using a hammer – it's a great tool for driving nails, but not so much for screwing in light bulbs. We need to be aware of when and how to apply abductive reasoning, and to continually update our understanding based on new evidence. By acknowledging its limitations and being mindful of our own biases, I think we can defend abduction as a rational approach, albeit a nuanced one.;I see what you mean, Professor. It's like we need to strike a balance between simplicity and nuance. But what about the critics of abduction who argue that it's not always a rational approach?

['\n The Buddha’s discourses collected in the Āgamas/Nikāyas analyze sentient experience from different standpoints: in terms of name-and-form (nāma-rūpa), the five aggregates (Skt., skandha, Pali, khandha), the twelve sense fields (āyatana), or the eighteen sense elements (dhātu). All these modes of analysis provide descriptions of sentient experience as a succession of physical and mental processes that arise and cease subject to various causes and conditions. A striking difference between the Sūtrānta and the Abhidharma worldviews is that the Abhidharma reduces the time scale of these processes so they are now seen as operating from moment to moment. Put differently, the Abhidharma reinterprets the terms by which the sūtras portray sequential processes as applying to discrete, momentary events .\n These events are referred to as dharmas (Pali, dhammas), differently from the singular dharma/dhamma that signifies the Buddha’s teaching(s). The Āgamas/Nikāyas use the form dharmas to convey a pluralistic representation of encountered phenomena, i.e., all sensory phenomena of whatever nature as we experience them through the six sense faculties (the five ordinary physical senses plus mind ). The canonical Abhidharma treatises, however, draw subtle distinctions within the scope of the mental and marginalize the differences between multiple varieties of mental capacities. Within this context, dharmas are seen as the objects of a specific mental capacity called mental cognitive awareness (Skt., manovijñāṇa, Pali, manoviññāṇa) that is considered the central cognitive operation in the process of sensory perception. Mental cognitive awareness is a particular type of consciousness that discerns between the stimuli impinging upon the sense faculties and that emerges when the requisite conditions come together. Dharmas are not merely mental objects like ideas, concepts, or memories. Rather, as the objects of mental cognitive awareness, dharmas may be rendered apperceptions: rapid consciousness-types (citta) that arise and cease in sequential streams, each having its own object, and that interact with the five externally directed sensory modalities (visual, auditory, etc.) of cognitive awareness. The canonical Abhidharma texts portray dharmas, then, as psycho-physical events with diverse capacities by means of which the mind unites and assimilates a particular perception, especially one newly presented, to a larger set or mass of ideas already possessed, thus comprehending and conceptualizing  it.\n Ultimately, dharmas are all that there is: all experiential events are understood as arising from the interaction of dharmas. While the analogy of atoms may be useful here, dharmas notably embrace both physical and mental phenomena, and are generally understood as evanescent events, occurrences, or dynamic properties rather than enduring  substances.  The Abhidharma exegesis thus attempts to provide an exhaustive account of every possible type of experience—every type of occurrence that may possibly present itself in one’s consciousness—in terms of its constituent dharmas. This enterprise involves breaking down the objects of ordinary perception into their constituent, discrete dharmas and clarifying their relations of causal conditioning. The overarching inquiry subsuming both the analysis of dharmas into multiple categories and their synthesis into a unified structure by means of their manifold relationships of causal conditioning is referred to as the “dharma theory.”'];Ah, you're onto something. Think of a movie. A movie appears to be a continuous flow of images, but in reality, it's just a series of individual frames, each one static, that create the illusion of movement when played in rapid succession. Similarly, Buddhist thinkers like the Abhidharma suggest that our experience of reality is composed of discrete, momentary events or 'dharmas.' These dharmas are the building blocks of our perception, and they arise and cease rapidly, giving us the impression of a continuous reality.;Professor Phil, I was reading this book about Buddhism and it said that reality is made up of tiny, fleeting moments.

The Abhidharma exegesis thus attempts to provide an exhaustive account of every possible type of experience—every type of occurrence that may possibly present itself in one’s consciousness—in terms of its constituent dharmas. This enterprise involves breaking down the objects of ordinary perception into their constituent, discrete dharmas and clarifying their relations of causal conditioning. The overarching inquiry subsuming both the analysis of dharmas into multiple categories and their synthesis into a unified structure by means of their manifold relationships of causal conditioning is referred to as the “dharma theory.”'];Ah, that's where things get really interesting. The Abhidharma philosophers would say that dharmas encompass both physical and mental phenomena, and that they're not separate or distinct from each other. Think of it like a conversation – the words I speak (physical phenomenon) and the meaning you understand (mental phenomenon) are not separate things, but are intimately connected and arise together as a single event. By analyzing reality into its constituent dharmas, we can begin to see how our experiences – both physical and mental – are intertwined and interdependent.;That makes sense, I think. But what about the idea that these dharmas are not just physical events, but also mental ones?

['\n The Buddha’s discourses collected in the Āgamas/Nikāyas analyze sentient experience from different standpoints: in terms of name-and-form (nāma-rūpa), the five aggregates (Skt., skandha, Pali, khandha), the twelve sense fields (āyatana), or the eighteen sense elements (dhātu). All these modes of analysis provide descriptions of sentient experience as a succession of physical and mental processes that arise and cease subject to various causes and conditions. A striking difference between the Sūtrānta and the Abhidharma worldviews is that the Abhidharma reduces the time scale of these processes so they are now seen as operating from moment to moment. Put differently, the Abhidharma reinterprets the terms by which the sūtras portray sequential processes as applying to discrete, momentary events .\n These events are referred to as dharmas (Pali, dhammas), differently from the singular dharma/dhamma that signifies the Buddha’s teaching(s). The Āgamas/Nikāyas use the form dharmas to convey a pluralistic representation of encountered phenomena, i.e., all sensory phenomena of whatever nature as we experience them through the six sense faculties (the five ordinary physical senses plus mind ). The canonical Abhidharma treatises, however, draw subtle distinctions within the scope of the mental and marginalize the differences between multiple varieties of mental capacities. Within this context, dharmas are seen as the objects of a specific mental capacity called mental cognitive awareness (Skt., manovijñāṇa, Pali, manoviññāṇa) that is considered the central cognitive operation in the process of sensory perception. Mental cognitive awareness is a particular type of consciousness that discerns between the stimuli impinging upon the sense faculties and that emerges when the requisite conditions come together. Dharmas are not merely mental objects like ideas, concepts, or memories. Rather, as the objects of mental cognitive awareness, dharmas may be rendered apperceptions: rapid consciousness-types (citta) that arise and cease in sequential streams, each having its own object, and that interact with the five externally directed sensory modalities (visual, auditory, etc.) of cognitive awareness. The canonical Abhidharma texts portray dharmas, then, as psycho-physical events with diverse capacities by means of which the mind unites and assimilates a particular perception, especially one newly presented, to a larger set or mass of ideas already possessed, thus comprehending and conceptualizing  it.\n Ultimately, dharmas are all that there is: all experiential events are understood as arising from the interaction of dharmas.

The overarching inquiry subsuming both the analysis of dharmas into multiple categories and their synthesis into a unified structure by means of their manifold relationships of causal conditioning is referred to as the “dharma theory.”'];The Abhidharma would say that the ultimate goal is not just understanding, but liberation. By gaining a deep understanding of how our experiences arise and how they're interconnected, we can begin to see through our habitual ways of perceiving and thinking, and develop a greater sense of freedom and clarity in our lives. It's like seeing through the illusion of the movie – once we understand the individual frames that make it up, we can begin to see the world in a new and more profound way.;Okay, I think I'm starting to get it.

While related, dispositions and powers are distinct. A disposition is more of an intrinsic property of an object, whereas a power or ability is often relational and involves an interaction with the environment. To illustrate, consider a light bulb: it has the disposition to produce light when a certain voltage is applied, but its power or ability to illuminate a room depends on many factors, like the presence of a power source and the environment.;I'm starting to see how these concepts are interconnected. But how do you distinguish between a disposition, like a glass being fragile, and a power or ability?

Some argue that dispositions are fundamental and that all powers can be reduced to them. Others, like philosopher Thomas Reid, suggest that powers, including those of agents, are distinct and irreducible. As I see it, dispositions are a member of the broader family of powers, but whether they're privileged or fundamental remains an open question.;That helps clarify the distinction.

Recognizing the ontological diversity of powers forces us to reexamine our understanding of agency, free will, and moral responsibility. It's a fascinating area of inquiry, and one that warrants further exploration in the realm of practical philosophy.;That makes sense. It seems to me that this has significant implications for how we think about agency and morality.

['\n Abilities, then, are a kind of power. What kind of power, precisely, is an ability? As the term will be understood here, there are two additional conditions that a power must meet in order for it to be an ability. First, abilities are distinguished by their subjects. Abilities are properties of agents, rather than of things that are not agents. Objects have dispositions and affordances — as a glass is disposed to break when struck, or affords the drinking of liquid — but they do not have abilities. Being a power of an agent is not, however, a sufficient condition for being an ability. This is because agents have powers that are not abilities. Therefore, second, abilities need to be distinguished by their objects: abilities relate agents to actions.\n Some examples may make the need for this second condition clear. Some powers, though properties of agents, do not intuitively involve any relation to action. Consider the power of understanding language. Understanding a sentence, while it is not wholly passive or arational, is not typically an action. In contrast, speaking a sentence is. Thus the power to understand French will not be an ability, on the present taxonomy. In contrast the power to speak French will be an ability, since it involves a relation to action. \n So, as the term will be understood here, an ability is a power that relates an agent to an action. This way of demarcating abilities, while serviceable for our purposes, is not unproblematic. For it inherits the problems involved in drawing the distinction between actions and non-actions. First, there is the problem that the domain of action is itself a contentious matter. Second, there is the problem that, even if we have settled on an account of action, it is plausible that the domain of action will be vague, so that there are some events that are not definitely actions, but that are not definitely not actions either. Arguably both of these points about action apply, also, to the property of being an agent. If this is right, then the present account of ability, which is cashed out in terms of agency and action, will be correspondingly contentious and vague. Borderline cases may, in the end, generate problems for the theory of ability. But such problems will not be central here. For giving such a theory will be difficult enough even when we focus on paradigm cases of agency and action, and so on paradigm cases of ability.\n Note there is a similarity between the present category of ability, as distinct from other powers, and the traditional category of active powers, where active powers are those that essentially involve the will . But it is not clear that these distinctions overlap exactly. For example, the power to will itself will clearly be an active power. It is less clear whether it will count as an ability, for the answer to that question will turn on the contentious question of whether willing is itself an action.'];That's an excellent question. Think of it like this: the difference is similar to having a piano versus actually playing it. Just as having the piano provides the possibility, but not the guarantee, of beautiful music, having the ability to do something similarly doesn't ensure that you'll actually do it.

Understanding language involves a certain passivity, a receptivity to meaning, whereas using language - like speaking - is more of an action.

['\n Abilities, then, are a kind of power. What kind of power, precisely, is an ability? As the term will be understood here, there are two additional conditions that a power must meet in order for it to be an ability. First, abilities are distinguished by their subjects. Abilities are properties of agents, rather than of things that are not agents. Objects have dispositions and affordances — as a glass is disposed to break when struck, or affords the drinking of liquid — but they do not have abilities. Being a power of an agent is not, however, a sufficient condition for being an ability. This is because agents have powers that are not abilities. Therefore, second, abilities need to be distinguished by their objects: abilities relate agents to actions.\n Some examples may make the need for this second condition clear. Some powers, though properties of agents, do not intuitively involve any relation to action. Consider the power of understanding language. Understanding a sentence, while it is not wholly passive or arational, is not typically an action. In contrast, speaking a sentence is. Thus the power to understand French will not be an ability, on the present taxonomy. In contrast the power to speak French will be an ability, since it involves a relation to action. \n So, as the term will be understood here, an ability is a power that relates an agent to an action. This way of demarcating abilities, while serviceable for our purposes, is not unproblematic. For it inherits the problems involved in drawing the distinction between actions and non-actions. First, there is the problem that the domain of action is itself a contentious matter. Second, there is the problem that, even if we have settled on an account of action, it is plausible that the domain of action will be vague, so that there are some events that are not definitely actions, but that are not definitely not actions either. Arguably both of these points about action apply, also, to the property of being an agent. If this is right, then the present account of ability, which is cashed out in terms of agency and action, will be correspondingly contentious and vague. Borderline cases may, in the end, generate problems for the theory of ability. But such problems will not be central here. For giving such a theory will be difficult enough even when we focus on paradigm cases of agency and action, and so on paradigm cases of ability.\n Note there is a similarity between the present category of ability, as distinct from other powers, and the traditional category of active powers, where active powers are those that essentially involve the will . But it is not clear that these distinctions overlap exactly. For example, the power to will itself will clearly be an active power. It is less clear whether it will count as an ability, for the answer to that question will turn on the contentious question of whether willing is itself an action.'];Absolutely. Think of cases like dreaming or sleepwalking. Are those actions, and if so, to what extent? The difficulty in distinguishing actions from non-actions seeps into our understanding of abilities as well. It's an issue with the theory, but for the purposes of our discussion, let's focus on the clearer cases where actions and abilities are more intuitively defined.;Actually, I'm not sure... Can't there be cases where it's difficult to tell whether something is an action or not?;['ability', 'kind', 'power', 'kind', 'power', 'precisely', 'ability', 'term', 'understand', 'additional', 'condition', 'power', 'meet', 'order', 'ability', 'ability', 'distinguish', 'subject', 'ability', 'property', 'agent', 'thing', 'agent', 'object', 'disposition', 'affordance', 'glass', 'disposed', 'break', 'strike', 'afford', 'drinking', 'liquid', 'ability', 'power', 'agent', 'sufficient', 'condition', 'ability', 'agent', 'power', 'ability', 'second', 'ability', 'need', 'distinguish', 'object', 'ability', 'relate', 'agent', 'example', 'need', 'second', 'condition', 'clear', 'power', 'property', 'agent', 'intuitively', 'involve', 'relation', 'action', 'consider', 'power', 'understand', 'language', 'understand', 'sentence', 'wholly', 'passive', 'arational', 'typically', 'action', 'contrast', 'speak', 'sentence', 'power', 'understand', 'french', 'ability', 'present', 'taxonomy', 'contrast', 'power', 'speak', 'french', 'ability', 'involve', 'relation', 'action', 'term', 'understand', 'ability', 'power', 'relate', 'agent', 'action', 'way', 'demarcate', 'ability', 'serviceable', 'purpose', 'unproblematic', 'inherit', 'problem', 'involve', 'draw', 'distinction', 'action', 'non', 'action', 'problem', 'domain', 'action', 'contentious', 'matter', 'second', 'problem', 'settle', 'account', 'action', 'plausible', 'domain', 'action', 'vague', 'event', 'definitely', 'action', 'definitely', 'action', 'arguably', 'point', 'action', 'apply', 'property', 'agent', 'right', 'present', 'account', 'ability', 'cash', 'term', 'agency', 'action', 'correspondingly', 'contentious', 'vague', 'borderline', 'case', 'end', 'generate', 'problem', 'theory', 'ability', 'problem', 'central', 'give', 'theory', 'difficult', 'focus', 'paradigm', 'case', 'agency', 'action', 'paradigm', 'case', 'note', 'similarity', 'present', 'category', 'ability', 'distinct', 'power', 'traditional', 'category', 'active', 'power', 'active', 'power', 'essentially', 'involve', 'clear', 'distinction', 'overlap', 'exactly', 'example', 'power', 'clearly', 'active', 'power', 'clear', 'count', 'ability', 'answer', 'question', 'turn', 'contentious', 'question', 'willing', 'action'];['absolutely', 'think', 'case', 'like', 'dream', 'sleepwalking', 'action', 'extent', 'difficulty', 'distinguish', 'action', 'non', 'action', 'seep', 'understanding', 'ability', 'issue', 'theory', 'purpose', 'discussion', 'let', 'focus', 'clear', 'case', 'action', 'ability', 'intuitively', 'define'];['actually', 'sure', 'case', 'difficult', 'tell', 'action']
['\n Some will expect that an account of ability would also be an account of what it is to know how to perform an action, on the supposition that one knows how to perform a certain action just in case one has the ability to perform that action.

This is how to accommodate those powers of agents that appear to be especially closely connected to practical intelligence, such as skills and talents — which we might collectively call the intelligent powers.

"['\n The previous section was primarily concerned with distinguishing abilities from other powers. But there is also a distinction to be made within the class of abilities itself. This is the distinction between general and specific abilities .\n The distinction between general and specific abilities may be brought out by way of example. Consider a well-trained tennis player equipped with ball and racquet, standing at the service line. There is, as it were, nothing standing between her and a serve: every prerequisite for her serving has been met. Such an agent is in a position to serve, or has serving as an option. Let us say that such an agent has the specific ability to serve.\n In contrast, consider an otherwise similar tennis player who lacks a racquet and ball, and is miles away from a tennis court. There is clearly a good sense in which such an agent has the ability to hit a serve: she has been trained to do so, and has done so many times in the past. Yet such an agent lacks the specific ability to serve, as that term was just defined. Let us say that such an agent has the general ability to serve.\n The concern of this article will be general abilities in this sense, and unqualified references to ‘ability’ should be read in that way. But specific abilities will also be at issue. This is for at least two reasons.\n The first is one of coverage: many of the proposals that are relevant to the understanding of ability, especially the classical ‘conditional analysis’ (discussed in Section 3.1 below), are naturally read as proposals about specific ability in the present sense, and a suitably broad conception of ability lets us keep these proposals within our domain of discussion.\n The second reason is more properly philosophical.

['\n Intuitively, claims about ability are claims about possibility. It is in some sense a truism that someone is able to perform some act just in case it is possible for her to perform it.\n To develop this purported truism, begin with the thought that for S to have an ability to A it is necessary, but not sufficient, that it be possible that S does A. This claim will be contentious for various more specialized sorts of possibility, such as nomic possibility. But if we may help ourselves to the idea of possibility simpliciter (‘metaphysical possibility,’\xa0on at least one reading of that phrase), then this claim appears plausible. (We will survey some historical and contemporary challenges to it below in Section 4.2.) On the other hand it seems implausible that this sort of possibility is a sufficient condition: there are any number of acts that that are metaphysically possible to perform that an agent might nonetheless not be able to perform.\n This suggests a natural hypothesis. To have an ability is for it to be possible to A in some restricted sense of possibility. As nomic possibility is possibility relative to the laws of nature, and epistemic possibility is possibility relative to what an agent knows, so may ability be possibility relative to some independently specifiable set of conditions.\n To render this hypothesis precisely, we may help ourselves to the formal framework of ‘possible worlds,’ which offers an elegant and powerful semantics for modal language. On this framework, a proposition is possible just in case it is true at some possible world. We can then say an agent is able to A just in case she performs that act at some world (or set of worlds) that satisfy some independently specifiable set of conditions.\n We thus arrive at the modal analysis of ability:\n (MA) S has the ability to A iff S does A at some world (or set of worlds) satisfying condition C.\n\n (MA) is actually not itself an analysis but rather a template for a general family of analyses. Different members of this family will be distinguished by the different candidates they might propose for C, as well as whether they quantify over individual worlds or sets of worlds. Nonetheless, these analyses demonstrate sufficient theoretical unity that they may be viewed, at an appropriate level of abstraction, as a single approach to the analysis of ability.\n Two points about (MA) bear noting. First, ‘modal’ here is being used in a relatively strict and narrow way. Sometimes ‘modal’ is used loosely to describe phenomena that are connected to possibility (and necessity) in some way or other. As noted above, it is a truism that there is some connection between ability and necessity, and so that ability is in this loose sense ‘modal.’ The proponent of (MA) is concerned with modality in a stricter sense: she proposes that ability may be analyzed in terms of the precise framework of propositions and possible worlds just adumbrated.

Indeed, philosophers differentiate between internal and external limitations. A promising approach is the 'modal analysis' of ability, which addresses this question by introducing possible worlds into the discussion.

One version of this analysis might state that 'S has the ability to A if and only if S does A at some world satisfying condition C.' The challenge then becomes defining what that condition C should look like – is it a world that's maximally similar to the actual world, or a world with different laws or moral principles?

(We will survey some historical and contemporary challenges to it below in Section 4.2.) On the other hand it seems implausible that this sort of possibility is a sufficient condition: there are any number of acts that that are metaphysically possible to perform that an agent might nonetheless not be able to perform.\n This suggests a natural hypothesis. To have an ability is for it to be possible to A in some restricted sense of possibility. As nomic possibility is possibility relative to the laws of nature, and epistemic possibility is possibility relative to what an agent knows, so may ability be possibility relative to some independently specifiable set of conditions.\n To render this hypothesis precisely, we may help ourselves to the formal framework of ‘possible worlds,’ which offers an elegant and powerful semantics for modal language. On this framework, a proposition is possible just in case it is true at some possible world. We can then say an agent is able to A just in case she performs that act at some world (or set of worlds) that satisfy some independently specifiable set of conditions.\n We thus arrive at the modal analysis of ability:\n (MA) S has the ability to A iff S does A at some world (or set of worlds) satisfying condition C.\n\n (MA) is actually not itself an analysis but rather a template for a general family of analyses. Different members of this family will be distinguished by the different candidates they might propose for C, as well as whether they quantify over individual worlds or sets of worlds. Nonetheless, these analyses demonstrate sufficient theoretical unity that they may be viewed, at an appropriate level of abstraction, as a single approach to the analysis of ability.\n Two points about (MA) bear noting. First, ‘modal’ here is being used in a relatively strict and narrow way. Sometimes ‘modal’ is used loosely to describe phenomena that are connected to possibility (and necessity) in some way or other. As noted above, it is a truism that there is some connection between ability and necessity, and so that ability is in this loose sense ‘modal.’ The proponent of (MA) is concerned with modality in a stricter sense: she proposes that ability may be analyzed in terms of the precise framework of propositions and possible worlds just adumbrated. The opponent of (MA), in turn, grants that ability has something to do with possibility but denies that any such analysis succeeds.\n Second, while (MA) has been presented as an alternative to (CA), (CA) is arguably just one particular version of (MA). For, as noted above, (CA) appeals to a subjunctive conditional, and the standard semantics for the subjunctive conditional  is told in terms of quantification over possible worlds. Specifically (on Stalnaker’s version) a subjunctive conditional is true just in case its consequent is true at the world where its antecedent is true that is otherwise maximally similar to the actual world. In these terms, (CA) is roughly equivalent to the following:\n (CAmodal) S has the ability to A iff S does A at a world at which S tries to A that is otherwise maximally similar to the actual world.\n\n This is patently a version of (MA), with ‘S tries to A and is otherwise maximally similar to the actual world’ serving as condition C.\n If this is correct, then most discussions of the analysis on ability in the twentieth century have focused on a special and somewhat idiosyncratic case of a much broader program of analysis, namely the program of giving a modal analysis of ability. The considerations brought forth in the remainder of this section, in contrast, are concerned with the general case.'];"Context does play a substantial role in understanding abilities – something that theories of ability need to acknowledge. Context doesn't just signify being in a physical environment; it can influence perception, reason, motivations, etc. Perhaps what we're really dealing with is how certain possibilities of acting fall under our control when we consider our current, intertwined circumstances.";I guess the boundaries of 'counterparts' seems less than fixed – does that ultimately mean our concept of 'ability' might be context-dependent, and its meaning influenced by the conditions under which we evaluate it?;['intuitively', 'claim', 'ability', 'claim', 'possibility', 'sense', 'truism', 'able', 'perform', 'act', 'case', 'possible', 'perform', 'develop', 'purported', 'truism', 'begin', 'thought', 'ability', 'necessary', 'sufficient', 'possible', 'claim', 'contentious', 'specialized', 'sort', 'possibility', 'nomic', 'possibility', 'help', 'idea', 'possibility', 'simpliciter', 'metaphysical', 'reading', 'phrase', 'claim', 'appear', 'plausible', 'survey', 'historical', 'contemporary', 'challenge', 'section', 'hand', 'implausible', 'sort', 'possibility', 'sufficient', 'condition', 'number', 'act', 'metaphysically', 'possible', 'perform', 'agent', 'nonetheless', 'able', 'suggest', 'natural', 'hypothesis', 'ability', 'possible', 'restricted', 'sense', 'possibility', 'nomic', 'possibility', 'possibility', 'relative', 'law', 'nature', 'epistemic', 'possibility', 'possibility', 'relative', 'agent', 'know', 'ability', 'possibility', 'relative', 'independently', 'specifiable', 'set', 'render', 'hypothesis', 'precisely', 'help', 'formal', 'framework', 'possible', 'world', 'offer', 'elegant', 'powerful', 'semantic', 'modal', 'language', 'framework', 'proposition', 'possible', 'case', 'true', 'possible', 'world', 'agent', 'able', 'case', 'perform', 'act', 'world', 'set', 'world', 'satisfy', 'independently', 'specifiable', 'set', 'arrive', 'modal', 'analysis', 'ability', 'iff', 'world', 'set', 'world', 'satisfy', 'condition', 'actually', 'analysis', 'template', 'general', 'family', 'analysis', 'different', 'member', 'family', 'distinguish', 'different', 'candidate', 'propose', 'quantify', 'individual', 'world', 'set', 'world', 'nonetheless', 'analysis', 'demonstrate', 'sufficient', 'theoretical', 'unity', 'view', 'appropriate', 'level', 'abstraction', 'single', 'approach', 'analysis', 'point', 'bear', 'note', 'modal', 'relatively', 'strict', 'narrow', 'way', 'modal', 'loosely', 'describe', 'phenomenon', 'connect', 'possibility', 'necessity', 'way', 'note', 'truism', 'connection', 'ability', 'necessity', 'ability', 'loose', 'sense', 'modal', 'proponent', 'concern', 'modality', 'strict', 'sense', 'propose', 'ability', 'analyze', 'term', 'precise', 'framework', 'proposition', 'possible', 'world', 'adumbrate', 'opponent', 'turn', 'grant', 'ability', 'possibility', 'deny', 'analysis', 'second', 'present', 'alternative', 'arguably', 'particular', 'version', 'note', 'appeal', 'subjunctive', 'conditional', 'standard', 'semantic', 'subjunctive', 'conditional', 'tell', 'term', 'quantification', 'possible', 'world', 'specifically', 'stalnaker', 'version', 'subjunctive', 'conditional', 'true', 'case', 'consequent', 'true', 'world', 'antecedent', 'true', 'maximally', 'similar', 'actual', 'world', 'term', 'roughly', 'equivalent', 'camodal', 'ability', 'iff', 'world', 'try', 'maximally', 'similar', 'actual', 'patently', 'version', 'try', 'maximally', 'similar', 'actual', 'world', 'serve', 'condition', 'correct', 'discussion', 'analysis', 'ability', 'twentieth', 'century', 'focus', 'special', 'somewhat', 'idiosyncratic', 'case', 'broad', 'program', 'analysis', 'program', 'give', 'modal', 'analysis', 'ability', 'consideration', 'bring', 'forth', 'remainder', 'section', 'contrast', 'concern', 'general', 'case'];['context', 'play', 'substantial', 'role', 'understand', 'ability', 'theory', 'ability', 'need', 'acknowledge', 'context', 'signify', 'physical', 'environment', 'influence', 'perception', 'reason', 'motivation', 'etc', 'deal', 'certain', 'possibility', 'act', 'fall', 'control', 'consider', 'current', 'intertwine', 'circumstance'];['guess', 'boundary', 'counterpart', 'fixed', 'ultimately', 'mean', 'concept', 'ability', 'context', 'dependent', 'meaning', 'influence', 'condition', 'evaluate']

['\n In the material mode, the modal analysis gives an account of what it is to have an ability in terms of quantification over possible worlds. In the formal mode, it gives a semantics for the ascription of ability — paradigmatically, sentences involving ‘can’ or ‘is able to’ — in terms of quantification over possible worlds.\n This formal aspect of the modal analysis has been prominent in the philosophical and linguistic literature because the standard semantics for ability ascriptions is an explicitly modal one. This is the view developed in a series of papers by Angelika Kratzer . Kratzer treats expressions such as ‘S can A’ and ‘S is able to A’ as possibility claims. That is, ‘S is able to A’ is true just in case there is a possible world w meeting certain conditions at which S does A. The conditions are that (i) w be accessible given some contextually-specified set of facts (the modal base) and (ii) that w be at least as good, according to a contextually-specified ranking of worlds (the ordering source), as any other accessible world. The Kratzer semantics is thus an instance of the modal analysis on its semantic formulation:\n (MAsemantic) ‘S is able to A’ is true iff S does A at some world (or set of worlds) satisfying condition C.\n\n A number of objection have been brought against the modal analysis in this latter, formal, aspect.\n One objection prominent in the recent literature  is that Kratzer’s semantics, or any analysis of the form of (MAsemantic), appears to have trouble marking an intuitive distinction between what someone is able to do and what it is possible for her to do. Let us say that an unskilled darts-player is about to throw a dart. She utters:\n (3) I am able to hit the bullseye\n\n Intuitively, what she says is false: she is not able to hit the bullseye, as she is a poor darts-player. Yet there is an accessible and perfectly good possible world w at which she hits the bullseye — which is just to say, in the object language, that it is possible for her to hit the bullseye.\n This case suggests the Kratzer semantics lacks the resources to capture the distinctively agentive force of a sentences such as (3). There are, in addition, a number of other outstanding empirical problems for Kratzer’s semantics for ability modals. One is the problem of accounting for ‘compulsion’ modals such as ‘I cannot but tell the truth’ . Another is that of accommodating the ‘actuality entailment’ whereby, in many languages, certain ability sentences entail that the act in question was actually performed . Whatever our verdict on (MAsemantic), the semantics of ability-ascriptions remains an unresolved and potentially rich issue at the boundary of linguistics and the philosophy of action.'];Well, that's the million-dollar question. I think we're only just beginning to scratch the surface of the complexities involved. New research in linguistics, philosophy of action, and philosophy of language will need to converge to provide a more adequate understanding of ability ascriptions. As we've seen, intuitive notions of ability resist complete formalization, and each attempt to clarify these notions raises more questions.

['\n As noted in Section 1.1, dispositions are simply one member of the broader family of powers, albeit one that has figured prominently in recent metaphysics. An alternative account of abilities might give an account of abilities in terms of some other kind of power, perhaps one better-suited to the distinctive aspects of abilities.\n One account of this kind is developed in a series of works by Barbara Vetter . Vetter proposes that our basic modal notion should be potentiality. On a traditional view (which Vetter rejects) dispositions involve a dyadic relation between a stimulus and a manifestation (for example: a glass is disposed to break when struck). In contrast, potentials involve a monadic relation to a manifestation (for example: a glass has the potential to break). This makes potentials especially well-suited to give an account of abilities, which also appear to involve a monadic relation to an act, namely the act denoted by the complement of an ability-ascription (for example: I am able to play tennis). To have an ability, Vetter argues, is simply to have a certain kind of potentiality. Vetter also provides an explicit semantics for agentive modality in terms of the ascription of potentiality , which constitutes a systematic alternative to (MA).\n Yet another view is suggested by recent work by Helen Steward emphasizing the traditional idea of a ‘two-way power’ . Steward argues that actions are exercises of two-way powers — ‘powers which an agent can exercise or not at a given moment, even holding all prior conditions at that moment fixed’ . These are to be contrasted with one-way powers, which manifest whenever their manifestation conditions are realized, as a fragile glass breaks whenever it is struck. Unlike both the new dispositionalists on the one hand and Vetter on the other, Steward sees a fundamental asymmetry between agents, who are bearers of two-way powers, and mere objects, who are are bearers only of one-way powers. It is natural then to think that what it is to have an ability is to have a two-way power of a certain kind, and that a theory of ability should follow from an account of agency and the two-way powers.\n We thus have at least three ‘power-based’ views of abilities: the new dispositionalism, Vetter’s potentiality-based view, and Steward’s two-way power-based view. It is instructive to consider how these three accounts differ with respect to two larger philosophical projects.\n One is the project of giving an analysis of modal language, including ability-ascriptions, in terms of possible worlds. The new dispositionalist rejects (CA) and (MA) but she is still, in principle, sympathetic with that project, insofar as she allows that disposition ascriptions themselves may be ultimately understood in terms of quantification over possible worlds. This kind of view is explicitly endorsed, for instance, by Smith . In contrast, Vetter is explicitly opposed to this project, while Steward’s view appears neutral on this question.\n Another is the project of arguing that agents’ abilities are, or are not, compatible with the possibility of determinism. This is a question we touched on briefly in Section 5.1. As noted there, the new dispositionalists are motivated, in part, by the project of arguing for compatibilism. In contrast, Steward is explicitly concerned to defend incompatibilism. (Vetter appears to be neutral on this question.) The question of how the analysis of ability bears on the free will debates looms over many of these discussions, and we will confront it directly and at some length below in Section 6.'];Well, I think that's a great question. When philosophers discuss abilities, they often mean it in a more fundamental sense – an ability is something that enables us to do certain things, regardless of whether we've developed that capacity through practice or if it's something we're born with. Think of it like this: having the ability to speak a language, even if you never learned it, doesn't mean you're proficient in it. You still have the capacity to learn and become proficient, though.;Professor, when we talk about abilities, are we referring to skills that can be developed over time, or is it more of an innate capacity?;['note', 'section', 'disposition', 'simply', 'member', 'broad', 'family', 'power', 'albeit', 'figure', 'prominently', 'recent', 'metaphysics', 'alternative', 'account', 'ability', 'account', 'ability', 'term', 'kind', 'power', 'well', 'suited', 'distinctive', 'aspect', 'account', 'kind', 'develop', 'series', 'work', 'barbara', 'vetter', 'vetter', 'propose', 'basic', 'modal', 'notion', 'potentiality', 'traditional', 'view', 'vetter', 'reject', 'disposition', 'involve', 'dyadic', 'relation', 'stimulus', 'manifestation', 'example', 'glass', 'disposed', 'break', 'strike', 'contrast', 'potential', 'involve', 'monadic', 'relation', 'manifestation', 'example', 'glass', 'potential', 'break', 'make', 'potential', 'especially', 'suit', 'account', 'ability', 'appear', 'involve', 'monadic', 'relation', 'act', 'act', 'denote', 'complement', 'ability', 'ascription', 'example', 'able', 'play', 'tennis', 'ability', 'vetter', 'argue', 'simply', 'certain', 'kind', 'potentiality', 'vetter', 'provide', 'explicit', 'semantic', 'agentive', 'modality', 'term', 'ascription', 'potentiality', 'constitute', 'systematic', 'alternative', 'view', 'suggest', 'recent', 'work', 'helen', 'steward', 'emphasize', 'traditional', 'idea', 'way', 'power', 'steward', 'argue', 'action', 'exercise', 'way', 'power', 'power', 'agent', 'exercise', 'give', 'moment', 'hold', 'prior', 'condition', 'moment', 'fix', 'contrast', 'way', 'power', 'manifest', 'manifestation', 'condition', 'realize', 'fragile', 'glass', 'break', 'strike', 'unlike', 'new', 'dispositionalist', 'hand', 'vetter', 'steward', 'see', 'fundamental', 'asymmetry', 'agent', 'bearer', 'way', 'power', 'mere', 'object', 'bearer', 'way', 'power', 'natural', 'think', 'ability', 'way', 'power', 'certain', 'kind', 'theory', 'ability', 'follow', 'account', 'agency', 'way', 'power', 'base', 'view', 'ability', 'new', 'dispositionalism', 'vetter', 'potentiality', 'base', 'view', 'steward', 'way', 'power', 'base', 'view', 'instructive', 'consider', 'account', 'differ', 'respect', 'large', 'philosophical', 'project', 'give', 'analysis', 'modal', 'language', 'include', 'ability', 'ascription', 'term', 'possible', 'world', 'new', 'dispositionalist', 'reject', 'principle', 'sympathetic', 'project', 'insofar', 'allow', 'disposition', 'ascription', 'ultimately', 'understand', 'term', 'quantification', 'possible', 'world', 'kind', 'view', 'explicitly', 'endorse', 'instance', 'smith', 'contrast', 'vetter', 'explicitly', 'oppose', 'project', 'steward', 'view', 'appear', 'neutral', 'project', 'argue', 'agent', 'ability', 'compatible', 'possibility', 'determinism', 'question', 'touch', 'briefly', 'section', 'note', 'new', 'dispositionalist', 'motivate', 'project', 'argue', 'compatibilism', 'contrast', 'steward', 'explicitly', 'concerned', 'defend', 'incompatibilism', 'vetter', 'appear', 'neutral', 'question', 'question', 'analysis', 'ability', 'bear', 'free', 'debate', 'loom', 'discussion', 'confront', 'directly', 'length', 'section'];['think', 'great', 'question', 'philosopher', 'discuss', 'ability', 'mean', 'fundamental', 'sense', 'ability', 'enable', 'certain', 'thing', 'regardless', 'develop', 'capacity', 'practice', 'bear', 'think', 'like', 'have', 'ability', 'speak', 'language', 'learn', 'mean', 'proficient', 'capacity', 'learn', 'proficient'];['professor', 'talk', 'ability', 'refer', 'skill', 'develop', 'time', 'innate', 'capacity']

It is natural then to think that what it is to have an ability is to have a two-way power of a certain kind, and that a theory of ability should follow from an account of agency and the two-way powers.\n We thus have at least three ‘power-based’ views of abilities: the new dispositionalism, Vetter’s potentiality-based view, and Steward’s two-way power-based view. It is instructive to consider how these three accounts differ with respect to two larger philosophical projects.\n One is the project of giving an analysis of modal language, including ability-ascriptions, in terms of possible worlds. The new dispositionalist rejects (CA) and (MA) but she is still, in principle, sympathetic with that project, insofar as she allows that disposition ascriptions themselves may be ultimately understood in terms of quantification over possible worlds. This kind of view is explicitly endorsed, for instance, by Smith . In contrast, Vetter is explicitly opposed to this project, while Steward’s view appears neutral on this question.\n Another is the project of arguing that agents’ abilities are, or are not, compatible with the possibility of determinism. This is a question we touched on briefly in Section 5.1. As noted there, the new dispositionalists are motivated, in part, by the project of arguing for compatibilism. In contrast, Steward is explicitly concerned to defend incompatibilism. (Vetter appears to be neutral on this question.) The question of how the analysis of ability bears on the free will debates looms over many of these discussions, and we will confront it directly and at some length below in Section 6.'];Exactly. Now, that's a perspective that Barbara Vetter would likely support. She argues that abilities should be understood in terms of potentiality, rather than dispositions. According to Vetter, dispositions require a specific stimulus to be triggered, whereas potentials don't. They just exist, regardless of the environment.;That's interesting.

['\n As noted in Section 1.1, dispositions are simply one member of the broader family of powers, albeit one that has figured prominently in recent metaphysics. An alternative account of abilities might give an account of abilities in terms of some other kind of power, perhaps one better-suited to the distinctive aspects of abilities.\n One account of this kind is developed in a series of works by Barbara Vetter . Vetter proposes that our basic modal notion should be potentiality. On a traditional view (which Vetter rejects) dispositions involve a dyadic relation between a stimulus and a manifestation (for example: a glass is disposed to break when struck). In contrast, potentials involve a monadic relation to a manifestation (for example: a glass has the potential to break). This makes potentials especially well-suited to give an account of abilities, which also appear to involve a monadic relation to an act, namely the act denoted by the complement of an ability-ascription (for example: I am able to play tennis). To have an ability, Vetter argues, is simply to have a certain kind of potentiality. Vetter also provides an explicit semantics for agentive modality in terms of the ascription of potentiality , which constitutes a systematic alternative to (MA).\n Yet another view is suggested by recent work by Helen Steward emphasizing the traditional idea of a ‘two-way power’ . Steward argues that actions are exercises of two-way powers — ‘powers which an agent can exercise or not at a given moment, even holding all prior conditions at that moment fixed’ . These are to be contrasted with one-way powers, which manifest whenever their manifestation conditions are realized, as a fragile glass breaks whenever it is struck.

However, I think the idea of two-way powers, as proposed by Helen Steward, offers a more nuanced view of abilities, especially when it comes to agency.

['\n Still other approaches to ability reject (CA) and (MA) while rejecting also the thought that some appeal to power — be it a disposition, a potentiality, or a two-way power — is needed to account for abilities.\n One recurrent thought is that, despite the various challenges that have been brought against it, ability is still intimately connected to some kind of relation between an agent’s volitions (tryings, intendings) and her actions. One semantically sophisticated development of this thought is Mandelkern et al, 2017, which proposes to take as basic a notion of ‘practically available actions,’ and to develop in terms of these a semantics for agentive modality, one on which conditionals linking volitions to actions continue to play an essential role. Another approach, in a recent book-length treatment of ability , proposes that abilities should be thought of in terms of proportions of cases where an agent successfully does what she intends to do . Both of these approaches are explicit in their denial of (CA), but they share — with the new dispositionalists — the thought that the analysis of ability should somehow appeal to a pattern of dependence between volition and action.\n This is not surprising. The conditional analysis is a redoubtable proposal, endorsed by many of the major figures in English-language philosophy. In light of that, it seems reasonable to try to discard the letter of (CA), but retain its spirit. For it may be that the historical failure of (CA) is due to difficulties and oversights that our perhaps firmer grasp of technical issues allows us to overcome. This is a sensible and well-motivated project, though it remains to be seen whether it will be, in the end, a successful one.\n There remain still other accounts that do not fit easily into the taxonomy provided here. These include primitivist proposals, which take ability or some closely related notion as analytically fundamental. One development of this idea is Maier 2015, who proposes, contrary to most authors, that specific ability is fundamentally prior to general ability. He argues that we should give an account of general ability in terms of specific abilities, which he calls ‘options’: roughly, an agent has the general ability to A iff she normally has A as an option. Options, in turn, are primitives. Much here will hang on saying more about options, and in what sense they figure as primitives in the theory of agency.\n Finally, an outline of a proposal by David Lewis  offers an altogether different approach to ability. Lewis is motivated, like many proponents of (CA), by the goal of defending compatibilism, but he takes (CA) to be unsatisfactory. He therefore proposes a non-conditional analysis of ability. His analysis, roughly, is that S has the ability to perform an action B just in case there is some basic action A such that (i) S’s doing A would cause or constitute S’s doing B and (ii) there is no obstacle to S’s doing A. The problem of giving a theory of ability then becomes the problem of giving a theory of obstacles, something at which Lewis, in his outline, makes a beginning. .\n Lewis’s proposal is an inspiration for further research in at least two ways. First, it indicates that Lewis, a systematic philosopher of modality, saw the problem of giving an analysis of ability as a significant outstanding project. Second, it demonstrates that genuinely novel approaches to ability remain available, and the project of giving a theory of ability may yet be in its early stages.'];Not exactly. Think of it like owning a set of golf clubs. Just because you own the clubs doesn't mean you can hit a hole-in-one. However, it's the potential to use the clubs effectively that makes owning them valuable. In a similar way, having an ability doesn't mean you're currently using it, but rather you have the capacity to do so.;Professor Phil, I've been trying to understand the concept of ability, and I was wondering, is having the ability to do something the same as actually being able to do it?;['approach', 'ability', 'reject', 'reject', 'thought', 'appeal', 'power', 'disposition', 'potentiality', 'way', 'power', 'need', 'account', 'recurrent', 'thought', 'despite', 'challenge', 'bring', 'ability', 'intimately', 'connect', 'kind', 'relation', 'agent', 'volition', 'trying', 'intending', 'action', 'semantically', 'sophisticated', 'development', 'thought', 'mandelkern', 'propose', 'basic', 'notion', 'practically', 'available', 'action', 'develop', 'term', 'semantic', 'agentive', 'modality', 'conditional', 'link', 'volition', 'action', 'continue', 'play', 'essential', 'role', 'approach', 'recent', 'book', 'length', 'treatment', 'ability', 'propose', 'ability', 'think', 'term', 'proportion', 'case', 'agent', 'successfully', 'intend', 'approach', 'explicit', 'denial', 'share', 'new', 'dispositionalist', 'thought', 'analysis', 'ability', 'appeal', 'pattern', 'dependence', 'volition', 'surprising', 'conditional', 'analysis', 'redoubtable', 'proposal', 'endorse', 'major', 'figure', 'english', 'language', 'philosophy', 'light', 'reasonable', 'try', 'discard', 'letter', 'retain', 'spirit', 'historical', 'failure', 'difficulty', 'oversight', 'firm', 'grasp', 'technical', 'issue', 'allow', 'overcome', 'sensible', 'motivate', 'project', 'remain', 'see', 'end', 'successful', 'remain', 'account', 'fit', 'easily', 'taxonomy', 'provide', 'include', 'primitivist', 'proposal', 'ability', 'closely', 'relate', 'notion', 'analytically', 'fundamental', 'development', 'idea', 'maier', 'propose', 'contrary', 'author', 'specific', 'ability', 'fundamentally', 'prior', 'general', 'ability', 'argue', 'account', 'general', 'ability', 'term', 'specific', 'ability', 'call', 'option', 'roughly', 'agent', 'general', 'ability', 'iff', 'normally', 'option', 'option', 'turn', 'primitive', 'hang', 'say', 'option', 'sense', 'figure', 'primitive', 'theory', 'finally', 'outline', 'proposal', 'david', 'lewis', 'offer', 'altogether', 'different', 'approach', 'ability', 'lewis', 'motivate', 'like', 'proponent', 'goal', 'defend', 'compatibilism', 'take', 'unsatisfactory', 'propose', 'non', 'conditional', 'analysis', 'ability', 'analysis', 'roughly', 'ability', 'perform', 'action', 'case', 'basic', 'action', 'cause', 'constitute', 'obstacle', 'problem', 'give', 'theory', 'ability', 'problem', 'give', 'theory', 'obstacle', 'lewis', 'outline', 'make', 'beginning', 'lewis', 'proposal', 'inspiration', 'research', 'way', 'indicate', 'lewis', 'systematic', 'philosopher', 'modality', 'see', 'problem', 'give', 'analysis', 'ability', 'significant', 'outstanding', 'project', 'second', 'demonstrate', 'genuinely', 'novel', 'approach', 'ability', 'remain', 'available', 'project', 'give', 'theory', 'ability', 'early', 'stage'];['exactly', 'think', 'like', 'own', 'set', 'golf', 'club', 'club', 'mean', 'hit', 'hole', 'potential', 'use', 'club', 'effectively', 'make', 'own', 'valuable', 'similar', 'way', 'have', 'ability', 'mean', 'currently', 'capacity'];['professor', 'phil', 'try', 'understand', 'concept', 'ability', 'wonder', 'have', 'ability', 'actually', 'able']
['\n Still other approaches to ability reject (CA) and (MA) while rejecting also the thought that some appeal to power — be it a disposition, a potentiality, or a two-way power — is needed to account for abilities.\n One recurrent thought is that, despite the various challenges that have been brought against it, ability is still intimately connected to some kind of relation between an agent’s volitions (tryings, intendings) and her actions. One semantically sophisticated development of this thought is Mandelkern et al, 2017, which proposes to take as basic a notion of ‘practically available actions,’ and to develop in terms of these a semantics for agentive modality, one on which conditionals linking volitions to actions continue to play an essential role. Another approach, in a recent book-length treatment of ability , proposes that abilities should be thought of in terms of proportions of cases where an agent successfully does what she intends to do . Both of these approaches are explicit in their denial of (CA), but they share — with the new dispositionalists — the thought that the analysis of ability should somehow appeal to a pattern of dependence between volition and action.\n This is not surprising. The conditional analysis is a redoubtable proposal, endorsed by many of the major figures in English-language philosophy. In light of that, it seems reasonable to try to discard the letter of (CA), but retain its spirit. For it may be that the historical failure of (CA) is due to difficulties and oversights that our perhaps firmer grasp of technical issues allows us to overcome. This is a sensible and well-motivated project, though it remains to be seen whether it will be, in the end, a successful one.\n There remain still other accounts that do not fit easily into the taxonomy provided here. These include primitivist proposals, which take ability or some closely related notion as analytically fundamental. One development of this idea is Maier 2015, who proposes, contrary to most authors, that specific ability is fundamentally prior to general ability. He argues that we should give an account of general ability in terms of specific abilities, which he calls ‘options’: roughly, an agent has the general ability to A iff she normally has A as an option. Options, in turn, are primitives. Much here will hang on saying more about options, and in what sense they figure as primitives in the theory of agency.\n Finally, an outline of a proposal by David Lewis  offers an altogether different approach to ability. Lewis is motivated, like many proponents of (CA), by the goal of defending compatibilism, but he takes (CA) to be unsatisfactory. He therefore proposes a non-conditional analysis of ability. His analysis, roughly, is that S has the ability to perform an action B just in case there is some basic action A such that (i) S’s doing A would cause or constitute S’s doing B and (ii) there is no obstacle to S’s doing A. The problem of giving a theory of ability then becomes the problem of giving a theory of obstacles, something at which Lewis, in his outline, makes a beginning. .\n Lewis’s proposal is an inspiration for further research in at least two ways. First, it indicates that Lewis, a systematic philosopher of modality, saw the problem of giving an analysis of ability as a significant outstanding project. Second, it demonstrates that genuinely novel approaches to ability remain available, and the project of giving a theory of ability may yet be in its early stages.'];That's an excellent connection to make. Consider the analogy of a car. If the car's engine is functioning correctly, it can move forward when the driver intends to accelerate. This connection between the driver's intention and the car's movement is similar to how some philosophers think about ability – as a link between our volitions and actions. However, this is a subject of ongoing debate, and there are different approaches to analyzing ability.;So, does that mean that ability is connected to our intentions, like trying or wanting to do something?;['approach', 'ability', 'reject', 'reject', 'thought', 'appeal', 'power', 'disposition', 'potentiality', 'way', 'power', 'need', 'account', 'recurrent', 'thought', 'despite', 'challenge', 'bring', 'ability', 'intimately', 'connect', 'kind', 'relation', 'agent', 'volition', 'trying', 'intending', 'action', 'semantically', 'sophisticated', 'development', 'thought', 'mandelkern', 'propose', 'basic', 'notion', 'practically', 'available', 'action', 'develop', 'term', 'semantic', 'agentive', 'modality', 'conditional', 'link', 'volition', 'action', 'continue', 'play', 'essential', 'role', 'approach', 'recent', 'book', 'length', 'treatment', 'ability', 'propose', 'ability', 'think', 'term', 'proportion', 'case', 'agent', 'successfully', 'intend', 'approach', 'explicit', 'denial', 'share', 'new', 'dispositionalist', 'thought', 'analysis', 'ability', 'appeal', 'pattern', 'dependence', 'volition', 'surprising', 'conditional', 'analysis', 'redoubtable', 'proposal', 'endorse', 'major', 'figure', 'english', 'language', 'philosophy', 'light', 'reasonable', 'try', 'discard', 'letter', 'retain', 'spirit', 'historical', 'failure', 'difficulty', 'oversight', 'firm', 'grasp', 'technical', 'issue', 'allow', 'overcome', 'sensible', 'motivate', 'project', 'remain', 'see', 'end', 'successful', 'remain', 'account', 'fit', 'easily', 'taxonomy', 'provide', 'include', 'primitivist', 'proposal', 'ability', 'closely', 'relate', 'notion', 'analytically', 'fundamental', 'development', 'idea', 'maier', 'propose', 'contrary', 'author', 'specific', 'ability', 'fundamentally', 'prior', 'general', 'ability', 'argue', 'account', 'general', 'ability', 'term', 'specific', 'ability', 'call', 'option', 'roughly', 'agent', 'general', 'ability', 'iff', 'normally', 'option', 'option', 'turn', 'primitive', 'hang', 'say', 'option', 'sense', 'figure', 'primitive', 'theory', 'finally', 'outline', 'proposal', 'david', 'lewis', 'offer', 'altogether', 'different', 'approach', 'ability', 'lewis', 'motivate', 'like', 'proponent', 'goal', 'defend', 'compatibilism', 'take', 'unsatisfactory', 'propose', 'non', 'conditional', 'analysis', 'ability', 'analysis', 'roughly', 'ability', 'perform', 'action', 'case', 'basic', 'action', 'cause', 'constitute', 'obstacle', 'problem', 'give', 'theory', 'ability', 'problem', 'give', 'theory', 'obstacle', 'lewis', 'outline', 'make', 'beginning', 'lewis', 'proposal', 'inspiration', 'research', 'way', 'indicate', 'lewis', 'systematic', 'philosopher', 'modality', 'see', 'problem', 'give', 'analysis', 'ability', 'significant', 'outstanding', 'project', 'second', 'demonstrate', 'genuinely', 'novel', 'approach', 'ability', 'remain', 'available', 'project', 'give', 'theory', 'ability', 'early', 'stage'];['excellent', 'connection', 'consider', 'analogy', 'car', 'car', 'engine', 'function', 'correctly', 'forward', 'driver', 'intend', 'accelerate', 'connection', 'driver', 'intention', 'car', 'movement', 'similar', 'philosopher', 'think', 'ability', 'link', 'volition', 'action', 'subject', 'ongoing', 'debate', 'different', 'approach', 'analyze', 'ability'];['mean', 'ability', 'connect', 'intention', 'like', 'try', 'want']

However, the issue is more complicated than that. For instance, imagine a skilled sniper who only hits their target 90% of the time. Does that mean they're less able to shoot accurately than someone who hits their target every single time, but only in controlled environments?

['There are not many sources on the life of Abner. The majority of the sources are autobiographical passages in his works (especially Mostrador de Justicia). Abner was born around 1260, probably in the Jewish community of Burgos, one of the major communities in Castile. While still Jewish, Abner worked as a book trader, a rabbi, and he may have been a physician as well. During this time he was the head of a yeshiva (Jewish academy) in Burgos, but we do not know if this yeshiva was a public institution or just a private group of students that met in his home. We know from a former pupil, Rabbi Isaac Pulgar, and from the sources that he utilizes in his works, that during the Jewish period of his life, Abner was a philosopher, being a part of the Maimonidean-Averroist trend of Jewish philosophy at the time.\n In spite of the majority opinion of modern  scholars,  Abner probably was not a Kabbalist before his conversion to Christianity. This mistake is based essentially on two sources: the fact that some of Abner’s arguments for the Trinity and Incarnation can be interpreted as deriving from Kabbalistic sources, and the existence of another Rabbi Abner (not a common name for Jews of his time), a Kabbalist whom Rabbi Isaac of Acre cited many times. In my opinion, Abner’s argument for the Trinity and Incarnation is not based on Kabbalistic sources, but stems from his Neo-Platonic and standard Christian scriptural  background.  Additionally, Abner (the apostate) did not use many important Kabbalistic  sources.  His opinions are not the same as the other Rabbi Abner’s (the one that Rabbi Isaac of Acre quotes), and we can see that the two authors do not share the same background, nor do they use the same sources, with Abner utilizing almost entirely sources taken from the Jewish philosophical and traditional rabbinic  corpuses.  almost all of Rabbi Abner’s sources are taken from the commentary of Nahmanides to the Torah, a book that Abner the apostate almost never quoted. \n The beginning of Abner’s doubts about Judaism began with the incident of a false messiah in Avila in 1295. According to Abner, the Jews of the community, which is in North Castile, went outside the city to welcome the messiah, but instead of the messiah they received a rainfall of crosses that stuck to their clothes. Some of the Jews who witnessed the miracle went to Abner for advice. This event instilled in Abner some doubts about the question of the reason for the ongoing exile of Israel and the truth of Judaism. After twenty-two years of feeling ambivalent  Abner wrote about his first revelation in a  dream.  In his dream he saw a man that told him to be “a teacher of righteousness” (mostrador de justicia, not coincidentally the name of Abner’s main book) and to bring his people to freedom from exile. This dream just accents the uncertainty of the Jewish Rabbi. After three more years of studies he had a second dream wherein he had the same revelation, this time noticing that on the clothes the man wore were crosses like the cross of Jesus the Christian. This dream prompted him toward his final conversion around 1320/1321. After his conversion, Abner became the sacristan of the collegiate church of Valladolid and devoted himself to the propagation of Christianity amongst his former fellows Jews (he had come to the conclusion that conversion to Christianity was the only way to be saved from the Exile). We know he wrote an extended polemicist oeuvre and that he took part in the anti-Jewish polemic effort in North Castile around 1336–1339. There was a public disputation between Abner and a rabbi that occurred probably around 1335–1336 on the subject of the prayer of the Jews against the apostates. This dispute was the main reason for the decree against this part of the Jewish prayer (birkatha-minim) by Alfonso XI in 1336. Abner probably died in 1347 or later.'];That's a thought-provoking question. I'd like to use the analogy of a riverbed. Imagine a river that's been flowing through a specific channel for years, carving out a deep path. The river's course represents our deeply ingrained beliefs and values. Now, what if a massive storm hits, causing a massive flood? The river might change course, flowing through new channels and creating a new path. This storm can be seen as a significant life event that challenges our existing worldview, forcing us to re-evaluate our beliefs and potentially leading to a transformation. However, it's also possible that even with such a significant event, the river might still return to its original course.;Professor Phil, is it possible for someone to change their deep-seated beliefs and values drastically, and if so, what triggers this kind of transformation?;['source', 'life', 'abner', 'majority', 'source', 'autobiographical', 'passage', 'work', 'especially', 'mostrador', 'justicia', 'abner', 'bear', 'probably', 'jewish', 'community', 'burgos', 'major', 'community', 'castile', 'jewish', 'abner', 'work', 'book', 'trader', 'rabbi', 'physician', 'time', 'head', 'yeshiva', 'jewish', 'academy', 'burgos', 'know', 'yeshiva', 'public', 'institution', 'private', 'group', 'student', 'meet', 'home', 'know', 'pupil', 'rabbi', 'isaac', 'pulgar', 'source', 'utilize', 'work', 'jewish', 'period', 'life', 'abner', 'philosopher', 'maimonidean', 'averroist', 'trend', 'jewish', 'philosophy', 'spite', 'majority', 'opinion', 'modern', 'scholar', 'abner', 'probably', 'kabbalist', 'conversion', 'christianity', 'mistake', 'base', 'essentially', 'source', 'fact', 'abner', 'argument', 'trinity', 'incarnation', 'interpret', 'derive', 'kabbalistic', 'source', 'existence', 'rabbi', 'abner', 'common', 'jews', 'time', 'kabbalist', 'rabbi', 'isaac', 'acre', 'cite', 'time', 'opinion', 'abner', 'argument', 'trinity', 'incarnation', 'base', 'kabbalistic', 'source', 'stem', 'neo', 'platonic', 'standard', 'christian', 'scriptural', 'background', 'additionally', 'abner', 'apostate', 'use', 'important', 'kabbalistic', 'source', 'opinion', 'rabbi', 'abner', 'rabbi', 'isaac', 'acre', 'quote', 'author', 'share', 'background', 'use', 'source', 'abner', 'utilize', 'entirely', 'source', 'take', 'jewish', 'philosophical', 'traditional', 'rabbinic', 'corpus', 'rabbi', 'abner', 'source', 'take', 'commentary', 'nahmanides', 'torah', 'book', 'abner', 'apostate', 'quote', 'beginning', 'abner', 'doubt', 'judaism', 'begin', 'incident', 'false', 'messiah', 'avila', 'accord', 'abner', 'jews', 'community', 'north', 'castile', 'go', 'outside', 'city', 'welcome', 'messiah', 'instead', 'messiah', 'receive', 'rainfall', 'crosse', 'stick', 'clothe', 'jews', 'witness', 'miracle', 'go', 'abner', 'advice', 'event', 'instill', 'abner', 'doubt', 'question', 'reason', 'ongoing', 'exile', 'israel', 'truth', 'judaism', 'year', 'feel', 'ambivalent', 'abner', 'write', 'revelation', 'dream', 'dream', 'see', 'man', 'tell', 'teacher', 'righteousness', 'mostrador', 'justicia', 'coincidentally', 'abner', 'main', 'book', 'bring', 'people', 'freedom', 'exile', 'dream', 'accent', 'uncertainty', 'jewish', 'rabbi', 'year', 'study', 'second', 'dream', 'revelation', 'time', 'notice', 'clothe', 'man', 'wear', 'crosse', 'like', 'cross', 'jesus', 'christian', 'dream', 'prompt', 'final', 'conversion', 'conversion', 'abner', 'sacristan', 'collegiate', 'church', 'valladolid', 'devote', 'propagation', 'christianity', 'fellow', 'jews', 'come', 'conclusion', 'conversion', 'christianity', 'way', 'save', 'exile', 'know', 'write', 'extend', 'polemicist', 'oeuvre', 'take', 'anti', 'jewish', 'polemic', 'effort', 'north', 'castile', 'public', 'disputation', 'abner', 'rabbi', 'occur', 'probably', 'subject', 'prayer', 'jews', 'apostate', 'dispute', 'main', 'reason', 'decree', 'jewish', 'prayer', 'birkatha', 'minim', 'alfonso', 'abner', 'probably', 'die', 'later'];['thought', 'provoke', 'question', 'like', 'use', 'analogy', 'riverbed', 'imagine', 'river', 'flow', 'specific', 'channel', 'year', 'carve', 'deep', 'path', 'river', 'course', 'represent', 'deeply', 'ingrain', 'belief', 'value', 'massive', 'storm', 'hit', 'cause', 'massive', 'flood', 'river', 'change', 'course', 'flow', 'new', 'channel', 'create', 'new', 'path', 'storm', 'see', 'significant', 'life', 'event', 'challenge', 'exist', 'worldview', 'force', 'evaluate', 'belief', 'potentially', 'lead', 'transformation', 'possible', 'significant', 'event', 'river', 'return', 'original', 'course'];['professor', 'phil', 'possible', 'change', 'deep', 'seat', 'belief', 'value', 'drastically', 'trigger', 'kind', 'transformation']

In fact, the people around us can be the storm that changes the river's course. Think of it like this: we're often part of a collective, a community that shares similar values and beliefs. However, sometimes we're confronted with alternative perspectives or people who challenge our views. This can create a sense of cognitive dissonance, which can lead to us re-evaluating our own beliefs and values. But, as the devil's advocate, I'd argue that it's also possible for individuals to resist this change, to cling to their existing worldview, even in the face of conflicting information or alternative perspectives.;That's an interesting analogy.

Now, imagine you're introduced to entirely new ingredients and cooking techniques that change your approach to culinary art. Are you still the same chef, or are you someone entirely new? In the case of conversion, the individual might not necessarily reject their past identity but rather reinterpret it through the lens of their new faith. They might integrate their past experiences and knowledge into their new worldview, drawing parallels between the two and finding ways to reconcile their dual identities.;I see what you mean. So, how does someone who's undergone a significant transformation, let's say a conversion to a new faith, reconcile their past and present selves?

During this time he was the head of a yeshiva (Jewish academy) in Burgos, but we do not know if this yeshiva was a public institution or just a private group of students that met in his home. We know from a former pupil, Rabbi Isaac Pulgar, and from the sources that he utilizes in his works, that during the Jewish period of his life, Abner was a philosopher, being a part of the Maimonidean-Averroist trend of Jewish philosophy at the time.\n In spite of the majority opinion of modern  scholars,  Abner probably was not a Kabbalist before his conversion to Christianity. This mistake is based essentially on two sources: the fact that some of Abner’s arguments for the Trinity and Incarnation can be interpreted as deriving from Kabbalistic sources, and the existence of another Rabbi Abner (not a common name for Jews of his time), a Kabbalist whom Rabbi Isaac of Acre cited many times. In my opinion, Abner’s argument for the Trinity and Incarnation is not based on Kabbalistic sources, but stems from his Neo-Platonic and standard Christian scriptural  background.  Additionally, Abner (the apostate) did not use many important Kabbalistic  sources.  His opinions are not the same as the other Rabbi Abner’s (the one that Rabbi Isaac of Acre quotes), and we can see that the two authors do not share the same background, nor do they use the same sources, with Abner utilizing almost entirely sources taken from the Jewish philosophical and traditional rabbinic  corpuses.  almost all of Rabbi Abner’s sources are taken from the commentary of Nahmanides to the Torah, a book that Abner the apostate almost never quoted. \n The beginning of Abner’s doubts about Judaism began with the incident of a false messiah in Avila in 1295. According to Abner, the Jews of the community, which is in North Castile, went outside the city to welcome the messiah, but instead of the messiah they received a rainfall of crosses that stuck to their clothes. Some of the Jews who witnessed the miracle went to Abner for advice. This event instilled in Abner some doubts about the question of the reason for the ongoing exile of Israel and the truth of Judaism. After twenty-two years of feeling ambivalent  Abner wrote about his first revelation in a  dream.  In his dream he saw a man that told him to be “a teacher of righteousness” (mostrador de justicia, not coincidentally the name of Abner’s main book) and to bring his people to freedom from exile. This dream just accents the uncertainty of the Jewish Rabbi. After three more years of studies he had a second dream wherein he had the same revelation, this time noticing that on the clothes the man wore were crosses like the cross of Jesus the Christian. This dream prompted him toward his final conversion around 1320/1321. After his conversion, Abner became the sacristan of the collegiate church of Valladolid and devoted himself to the propagation of Christianity amongst his former fellows Jews (he had come to the conclusion that conversion to Christianity was the only way to be saved from the Exile). We know he wrote an extended polemicist oeuvre and that he took part in the anti-Jewish polemic effort in North Castile around 1336–1339. There was a public disputation between Abner and a rabbi that occurred probably around 1335–1336 on the subject of the prayer of the Jews against the apostates. This dispute was the main reason for the decree against this part of the Jewish prayer (birkatha-minim) by Alfonso XI in 1336. Abner probably died in 1347 or later.'];Well, that's the beauty of philosophy – it encourages us to think creatively and challenge our existing perspectives. As we explored in our conversation today, significant transformations can be triggered by various factors, including life events and exposure to alternative perspectives. By using analogies like the riverbed and the chef, we've managed to shed some light on the complexities of human transformation and the reconciliation of past and present selves.;That's a clever comparison.

Only a translation (probably by Abner himself) in Castilian exists today, whereas the original Hebrew was lost. The book starts with a brief introduction wherein Abner writes about the reasons for his conversion (the incident in Avila and his two dreams). The main part of the book is a debate between a Christian (the master) and a Jew (the rebel). In contrast to other works similar to this type of polemic debate, in the Mostrador, the rebel does not become a Christian, and despite his losing the debate, the Jew continues to believe in his ostensibly false religion.

Abner did not divide this book into formal sections, though the book contains four main subjects presented in a contiguous fashion: (1) an introduction wherein Abner attacks his former pupil on his philosophical position and other personal matters between the two; (2) the Trinity and how it can be based on philosophy, scripture and quotes from the Jewish rabbinic literature; (3) the necessary existence of the incarnation of divinity in the world; and (4) a proof of the aforementioned Christian beliefs derived from scripture and other Jewish sources (Talmud and Midrashim).

Here Abner distinguishes between the regular Jewish people (that have some hope to become Christian and to be saved) and Jewish philosophers (like Pulgar).

The book starts with a brief introduction wherein Abner writes about the reasons for his conversion (the incident in Avila and his two dreams). The main part of the book is a debate between a Christian (the master) and a Jew (the rebel). In contrast to other works similar to this type of polemic debate, in the Mostrador, the rebel does not become a Christian, and despite his losing the debate, the Jew continues to believe in his ostensibly false religion. The book is divided into ten chapters, with each chapter being subdivided into a number of paragraphs. Each paragraph is a speech by one of the protagonists of the  debate.\n Summary of the chapters:\n Responses to the Blasphemer (Teshuvot la-Meharef): this book survived both in the original  Hebrew  and in a Castilian  translation.  This book is a response to the different letters that Abner’s only known student, Rabbi Isaac Pulgar, wrote against his determinist and Christian  writings.  Abner did not divide this book into formal sections, though the book contains four main subjects presented in a contiguous fashion: (1) an introduction wherein Abner attacks his former pupil on his philosophical position and other personal matters between the two; (2) the Trinity and how it can be based on philosophy, scripture and quotes from the Jewish rabbinic literature; (3) the necessary existence of the incarnation of divinity in the world; and (4) a proof of the aforementioned Christian beliefs derived from scripture and other Jewish sources (Talmud and Midrashim). In this last part, which takes up almost half the book, Abner argues that the messiah had already come and that Christianity is true.\n While Abner’s arguments regarding the Trinity and Incarnation are generally more developed in Mostradorde Justicia, the philosophical importance of this work resides with his critique of the Jewish philosopher. Here Abner distinguishes between the regular Jewish people (that have some hope to become Christian and to be saved) and Jewish philosophers (like Pulgar). The latter are hopeless and are left with no religion, mostly due to their opinions that only the people who attain scientific knowledge have some kind of existence after death. Due to their feeling elevated over others, these philosophers have no hope of improving and accepting the truth of Christianity. Parts of Abner’s critique of Jewish philosophers in this book most probably influenced Crescas.\n Libro de la Ley (Book of the Law). This work survived only  fragmentally  in Castilian. The major argument of Abner in this book is that the Jewish people forgot the secrets of the Torah, which are manifested by the Christian doctrines, especially the Trinity.\n Sefer Teshuvot ha-Meshubot (The Book of Responses to the Apostasies) exists only in  Hebrew.  There are three polemic  letters  that deal especially with scriptural arguments on the subject of the coming of the  messiah.']";Ah, excellent question. Abner's other works, such as Responses to the Blasphemer, also deal with the relationship between Christianity and Judaism. However, in these works, Abner takes a more critical approach, arguing that Jewish philosophers are unable to accept Christianity due to their narrow focus on scientific knowledge. He sees this as a limitation, as it prevents them from understanding the true nature of God.;That's really interesting. It sounds like Abner is trying to present a more nuanced view of the debate between Christianity and Judaism. But what about his other works?

Abner's views on the Trinity and the Incarnation are central to his philosophical project. He argues that the Trinity can be understood through reason and scripture, and that the Incarnation is necessary for human salvation. However, he also acknowledges that these concepts are complex and difficult to understand, and that they require a deep understanding of scripture and tradition.;I see. So Abner is trying to challenge the Jewish philosophical tradition, while also presenting a more nuanced view of the debate between Christianity and Judaism.

['\n One must distinguish between two kinds of influence Abner had. Abner influenced with his polemical works the Jewish-Christian debate until the end of the Middle Ages. Some born-Christians, like Alfonso de Espina, and especially Jewish apostates, like Pablo de Santa Maria, utilized his polemical works. Against this trend, there are more than five Jewish polemicist works that explicitly answer the polemical arguments of  Abner.  Despite the utilization of Abner in debates, his works had almost no philosophical influence on Christian theology because the Christian participants in the debates utilized the quotations of the Jewish sources by Abner and not his theological arguments as such, which in their content were very different from the official Catholic dogma.\n The second way in which Abner had lasting influence was on the purely philosophical plane. It should be noted that the direct philosophical influence of Abner was only on the Jewish community. In fact we do not see that any Christian philosophers read the works of Jewish apostates in any other forum apart from the purely polemical one. By contrast, in the Jewish community the works of Abner had an important impact until the expulsion of the Jews from Spain in 1492. The deterministic opinion of Abner is with no doubt one of the major causes to the extensive number of works written on this subject in the 14th and 15th centuries by Jewish philosophers. For the most part, these works were against the opinion of Abner. The most impressive philosophical influence of Abner was on Rabbi Hasdai Crescas . Crescas was the main Jewish philosopher during the end of the Middle Ages. Despite their opposite positions in the Jewish-Christian debate (Crescas wrote one of the more philosophical anti-Christian  works),  Crescas borrowed some of the major original philosophical opinions of Abner, including determinism, the difference between the attributes of the essence and the attributes that are essential, and the criticism of Aristotelian science. With regard to this entire subject, Crescas molded his opinion using Abner combined with other sources. In spite of this important change, we can clearly see signs of the philosophy of Abner in the writing of Crescas, and these signs constitute nearly all the post medieval influence of Abner on Jewish and general Western philosophy.'];That's a fascinating topic.

The tactic might be useful in a particular debate, but the strategy – the underlying philosophical approach – might remain unchanged.;Exactly.

Despite their opposite positions in the Jewish-Christian debate (Crescas wrote one of the more philosophical anti-Christian  works),  Crescas borrowed some of the major original philosophical opinions of Abner, including determinism, the difference between the attributes of the essence and the attributes that are essential, and the criticism of Aristotelian science. With regard to this entire subject, Crescas molded his opinion using Abner combined with other sources.

['\n One must distinguish between two kinds of influence Abner had. Abner influenced with his polemical works the Jewish-Christian debate until the end of the Middle Ages. Some born-Christians, like Alfonso de Espina, and especially Jewish apostates, like Pablo de Santa Maria, utilized his polemical works. Against this trend, there are more than five Jewish polemicist works that explicitly answer the polemical arguments of  Abner.  Despite the utilization of Abner in debates, his works had almost no philosophical influence on Christian theology because the Christian participants in the debates utilized the quotations of the Jewish sources by Abner and not his theological arguments as such, which in their content were very different from the official Catholic dogma.\n The second way in which Abner had lasting influence was on the purely philosophical plane. It should be noted that the direct philosophical influence of Abner was only on the Jewish community. In fact we do not see that any Christian philosophers read the works of Jewish apostates in any other forum apart from the purely polemical one. By contrast, in the Jewish community the works of Abner had an important impact until the expulsion of the Jews from Spain in 1492. The deterministic opinion of Abner is with no doubt one of the major causes to the extensive number of works written on this subject in the 14th and 15th centuries by Jewish philosophers. For the most part, these works were against the opinion of Abner. The most impressive philosophical influence of Abner was on Rabbi Hasdai Crescas . Crescas was the main Jewish philosopher during the end of the Middle Ages.

['\n\n The only major work that we possess of Judah Abrabanel is the Dialoghi d’amore. There is some debate as to when the work was actually written.

It's possible that Judah Abrabanel was influenced by the works of other thinkers who wrote about the harmony of the spheres. The dedication to Pico della Mirandola is also telling, as it suggests that Judah valued Pico's ideas and might have seen himself as part of a broader intellectual community.

"['\n\n The central question concerning the language of the Dialoghi’s composition is: How could a Jewish refugee from Portugal show such facility with Italian, let alone the Tuscan dialect, since Judah seems to have spent very little time in  Tuscany?   Those who argue for a Latin original point to the fact that (1) he was a physician and would have known Latin, and (2) a phrase by Yosef Shlomo Delmedigo  in his Mikhtav Ahuz suggesting that he was going to translate Judah’s work from Latin. Those who argue for a Hebrew original point to another phrase, this time by Claudio Tolemei , a non-Jew, which states that Judah composed his treatise in sua lingua (“his own language”).  Although, as others have pointed out, such a phrase could quite easily refer to “his own style.”\n\n However, given the evidence, an Italian original for the work seems most likely since (1) all the manuscripts, including Mariano Lenzi’s edition of 1535, are in Italian; (2) it seems that Judah had lived in Italy for close to twenty years by the time that he wrote the Dialoghi (more than enough time for someone to gain an intimate knowledge of Italian, especially someone proficient in Latin and Spanish vernaculars); (3) neither later Jewish authors, e.g., Azaria   de’Rossi,  nor non-Jewish authors, e.g., Tullia  d’Aragona, had any reason to suspect that it was written in a language other than Italian; (4) if we assume the later date of 1511–1512, many non-Tuscan Italian authors of this period called for the adoption of Tuscan as a literary language, owing primarily to the fact that this was the language of Petrarch  and Boccaccio  ;  and, (5) as for the question of the Tuscan dialect of the work, many Italian printers of the early sixteenth century “Tuscanized” Italian according to set  criteria.\n\n Moreover, many Jewish authors in the fifteenth- and sixteenth-centuries increasingly resorted to Romance vernaculars in order to attract a Jewish audience (including conversos and ex-conversos), which no longer understood Hebrew. In sixteenth-century Italy, larger trends in rhetoric and the use of language increasingly led to the creation of the ideal of a pure Italian language. In this regard, Judah becomes an important transitional thinker in the encounter between Judaism and the Italian Renaissance. Whereas his father, Don Isaac, could still adapt humanistic themes to his Hebrew writings, which were still primarily in conversation with medieval  thought,  increasingly in Judah’s generation the only way to engage in a full-scale examination of the universal tendencies associated with Humanism was to write in the vernacular.\n\n Finally, the very genre of the Dialoghi, that of the trattato d’amore (“treatise on love”), was the product of the Italian vernacular of the late fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries.

Think of it like a skilled musician who can play multiple instruments. Just as a musician can learn to master a new instrument, a writer can develop proficiency in a new language.

It's like trying to recreate a local recipe without being familiar with the specific ingredients and cooking techniques of that region. You might get close, but you might also miss out on some of the subtle flavors and textures that make the dish truly authentic. That being said, a skilled writer can still learn to approximate the dialect and adapt it to their own voice, especially if they've spent a significant amount of time immersed in that culture.

It's also about the underlying order and coherence of the universe. So, for example, a mathematical proof can be seen as beautiful because of its elegance and simplicity, even if it's not conventionally beautiful. Our love for these abstract concepts is what allows us to appreciate their beauty, even if it's not immediately apparent. To put it another way, beauty is what shines through when we experience order, coherence, and unity – whether it's in a work of art, a mathematical proof, or a scientific concept.";That makes sense. But what about things that aren't necessarily beautiful, like a mathematical proof or a scientific concept?

Such antagonism reflects the broader context of the Maimonidean controversies, in which philosophers sought to make philosophy known to a broader Jewish public often by means of dramatic dialogues or philosophical novels. Those opposed to the Aristotelian-Maimonidean paradigm of philosophy often blamed such treatises for weakening the faith of Jews by diminishing their commitment to the halakhah (law) and, thus, making them more susceptible to conversion.

Unlike many of his medieval predecessors, he did not define this world, the world of form and matter, in terms of privation or its distance from the divine. On the contrary, he envisages this world as the arena wherein individuals encounter, through sensual particulars, the beauty and love of the divine.   Abrabanel’s emphasis, like that of many of his Renaissance contemporaries, on aesthetics and the phenomenal world would eventually become an important dimension of 16th- and 17th -century natural philosophy. We do know, for example, that Baruch Spinoza had a copy of the Dialoghi in his library.'];That's an excellent question. I'd like to use an analogy to help us understand this. Think of a master painter working on a new piece. They may have a vision of what they want to create, but the precise execution – the brushstrokes, colors, and textures – is an expression of their love for the art form. The beauty that emerges is not just from the technical skill, but also from the love and passion the artist pours into it. In this sense, you can say that the art, which represents the world, is infused with the artist's love and beauty. Now, apply this idea to a philosophical system, and the concept of grace enters as the natural, almost miraculous, unfolding of the world according to its inherent principles of love and beauty. This convergence of love, beauty, and the world's creation is exactly what Judah Abrabanel explores in his work, Dialoghi.;Professor Phil, I've been reading about the role of grace in different cultures and philosophies.

A philosophical system might incorporate diverse ideas and express them in a more inviting way, but one risks the possibility that the primary principles might get the ""graft"" they receive confused for the original plant. In contrast, well-performed grafting can help the overall plant thrive.";That makes sense.

['\n\n One of the most surprising features concerning the reception history of the Dialoghi is that a work of Jewish philosophy would subsequently become a European bestseller among non-Jews. In the years immediately following its Italian publication, the Dialoghi was translated into virtually every European vernacular. This popularity might be the result of the prominent role that grace (grazia) plays in the Dialoghi or the fact that Judah frequently stresses the interlocking relationship between the corporeal and the spiritual, something that seems to have resonated with contemporaneous Christian treatments of the incarnation in literary  fiction.\n\n This popularity of the work has led some to posit that Judah Abrabanel’s thought is epigonic, responsible for disseminating the thought of “great thinkers” such as Marsilio Ficino  and Giovanni Pico della Mirandola  to a wider audience. This essay’s point of departure, however, has been that the thought of Judah Abrabanel, while dependent upon certain features of these earlier thinkers, nevertheless makes significant departures from them in terms of his construction of an overarching system that revolves around the twin principles of love and beauty\n\n Paradoxically, the initial response of Jews to the Dialoghi was for the most part negative. Some of the earliest criticisms, especially those of Saul ha-Kohen Ashkenazi, fault Judah with rationalizing kabbalistic principles. Ashkenazi, in a letter to Don Isaac Abrabanel, criticizes Judah for his lack of philosophical esotericism, and for spending too much time on linguistic matters, such as riddles and eloquence. Such antagonism reflects the broader context of the Maimonidean controversies, in which philosophers sought to make philosophy known to a broader Jewish public often by means of dramatic dialogues or philosophical novels. Those opposed to the Aristotelian-Maimonidean paradigm of philosophy often blamed such treatises for weakening the faith of Jews by diminishing their commitment to the halakhah (law) and, thus, making them more susceptible to conversion.   Despite such initial criticisms, however, subsequent generations stressed the interrelationship between Platonism and kabbalah on the one hand, and philosophy and aesthetics on the other. Notable individuals include Azariah de Rossi  and Judah Moscato .\n\n The actual influence that the Dialoghi would have on subsequent thinkers is more difficult to judge. Essentially, Judah adopted certain trajectories of medieval cosmology and psychology, combined them with Renaissance notions of beauty, and thereby created a full-blown aesthetics of Judaism. This led him to conceive of the universe as a living, dynamic structure, in which all levels share in a symbiotic and organic relationship. Unlike many of his medieval predecessors, he did not define this world, the world of form and matter, in terms of privation or its distance from the divine. On the contrary, he envisages this world as the arena wherein individuals encounter, through sensual particulars, the beauty and love of the divine.   Abrabanel’s emphasis, like that of many of his Renaissance contemporaries, on aesthetics and the phenomenal world would eventually become an important dimension of 16th- and 17th -century natural philosophy. We do know, for example, that Baruch Spinoza had a copy of the Dialoghi in his library.'];That's a crucial distinction. When we go back to the role of love and beauty in philosophical systems, you'd notice thinkers like Judah Abrabanel – not to mention Baruch Spinoza later on – try to integrate rationality, aesthetics, and spirituality. Their method was not just to 'terrify people into the faith,' so to speak, but to instead let the philosophical journey – and its inquiry into the actual nature of love, beauty, and human understanding – guide people deeper into the faith. In the context of Abrabanel's work, critics may have thought he relied too heavily on the rational understanding and perhaps went too far with it, which obscured what his goals actually were.;I see what you mean. It seemed like some critics blamed particular philosophical works for weakening faith, but also didn't other critics praise the use of rationality to deepen understanding?;['surprising', 'feature', 'concern', 'reception', 'history', 'dialoghi', 'work', 'jewish', 'philosophy', 'subsequently', 'european', 'bestseller', 'non', 'jews', 'year', 'immediately', 'follow', 'italian', 'publication', 'dialoghi', 'translate', 'virtually', 'european', 'vernacular', 'popularity', 'result', 'prominent', 'role', 'grace', 'grazia', 'play', 'dialoghi', 'fact', 'judah', 'frequently', 'stress', 'interlock', 'relationship', 'corporeal', 'spiritual', 'resonate', 'contemporaneous', 'christian', 'treatment', 'incarnation', 'literary', 'popularity', 'work', 'lead', 'posit', 'judah', 'abrabanel', 'thought', 'epigonic', 'responsible', 'disseminate', 'thought', 'great', 'thinker', 'marsilio', 'ficino', 'giovanni', 'pico', 'della', 'mirandola', 'wide', 'audience', 'essay', 'point', 'departure', 'thought', 'judah', 'abrabanel', 'dependent', 'certain', 'feature', 'early', 'thinker', 'make', 'significant', 'departure', 'term', 'construction', 'overarching', 'system', 'revolve', 'twin', 'principle', 'love', 'paradoxically', 'initial', 'response', 'jews', 'dialoghi', 'negative', 'early', 'criticism', 'especially', 'saul', 'kohen', 'ashkenazi', 'fault', 'judah', 'rationalize', 'kabbalistic', 'principle', 'ashkenazi', 'letter', 'don', 'isaac', 'abrabanel', 'criticize', 'judah', 'lack', 'philosophical', 'esotericism', 'spend', 'time', 'linguistic', 'matter', 'riddle', 'eloquence', 'antagonism', 'reflect', 'broad', 'context', 'maimonidean', 'controversy', 'philosopher', 'seek', 'philosophy', 'know', 'broad', 'jewish', 'public', 'mean', 'dramatic', 'dialogue', 'philosophical', 'novel', 'oppose', 'aristotelian', 'maimonidean', 'paradigm', 'philosophy', 'blame', 'treatise', 'weaken', 'faith', 'jews', 'diminish', 'commitment', 'halakhah', 'law', 'make', 'susceptible', 'conversion', 'despite', 'initial', 'criticism', 'subsequent', 'generation', 'stress', 'interrelationship', 'platonism', 'kabbalah', 'hand', 'philosophy', 'aesthetic', 'notable', 'individual', 'include', 'azariah', 'rossi', 'judah', 'moscato', 'actual', 'influence', 'dialoghi', 'subsequent', 'thinker', 'difficult', 'judge', 'essentially', 'judah', 'adopt', 'certain', 'trajectory', 'medieval', 'cosmology', 'psychology', 'combine', 'renaissance', 'notion', 'beauty', 'create', 'blow', 'aesthetic', 'judaism', 'lead', 'conceive', 'universe', 'living', 'dynamic', 'structure', 'level', 'share', 'symbiotic', 'organic', 'relationship', 'unlike', 'medieval', 'predecessor', 'define', 'world', 'world', 'form', 'matter', 'term', 'privation', 'distance', 'divine', 'contrary', 'envisage', 'world', 'arena', 'individual', 'encounter', 'sensual', 'particular', 'beauty', 'love', 'divine', 'abrabanel', 'emphasis', 'like', 'renaissance', 'contemporary', 'aesthetic', 'phenomenal', 'world', 'eventually', 'important', 'dimension', 'natural', 'philosophy', 'know', 'example', 'baruch', 'spinoza', 'copy', 'dialoghi', 'library'];['crucial', 'distinction', 'role', 'love', 'beauty', 'philosophical', 'system', 'notice', 'thinker', 'like', 'judah', 'abrabanel', 'mention', 'baruch', 'spinoza', 'later', 'try', 'integrate', 'rationality', 'aesthetic', 'spirituality', 'method', 'terrify', 'people', 'faith', 'speak', 'instead', 'let', 'philosophical', 'journey', 'inquiry', 'actual', 'nature', 'love', 'beauty', 'human', 'understanding', 'guide', 'people', 'deeply', 'faith', 'context', 'abrabanel', 'work', 'critic', 'think', 'rely', 'heavily', 'rational', 'understanding', 'go', 'far', 'obscure', 'goal', 'actually'];['mean', 'like', 'critic', 'blame', 'particular', 'philosophical', 'work', 'weakening', 'faith', 'critic', 'praise', 'use', 'rationality', 'deepen', 'understanding']
['The abstract/concrete distinction has a curious status in contemporary philosophy. It is widely agreed that the ontological distinction is of fundamental importance, but as yet, there is no standard account of how it should be drawn. There is a consensus about how to classify certain paradigm cases. For example, it is usually acknowledged that numbers and the other objects of pure mathematics, like pure sets, are abstract (if they exist), whereas rocks, trees, and human beings are concrete. In everyday language, it is common to use expressions that refer to concrete entities as well as those that apparently refer to abstractions such as democracy, happiness, motherhood, etc. Moreover, formulations of mathematical theories seem to appeal directly to abstract entities, and the use of mathematical expressions in the empirical sciences seems indispensable to the formulation of our best empirical theories .  Finally, apparent reference to abstract entities such as sets, properties, concepts, propositions, types, and possible worlds, among others, is ubiquitous in different areas of philosophy.\n Though there is a pervasive appeal to abstract objects, philosophers have nevertheless wondered whether they exist. The alternatives are: platonism, which endorses their existence, and nominalism, which denies the existence of abstract objects across the board. (See the entries on  nominalism in metaphysics  and  platonism in metaphysics.)  But the question of how to draw the distinction between abstract and concrete objects is an open one: it is not clear how one should characterize these two categories nor is there a definite list of items that fall under one or the other category (assuming neither is empty).\n The first challenge, then, is to articulate the distinction, either by defining the terms explicitly or by embedding them in a theory that makes their connections to other important categories more explicit. In the absence of such an account, the philosophical significance of the contrast remains uncertain, for the attempt to classify things as abstract or concrete by appeal to intuition is often problematic. Is it clear that scientific theories (e.g., the general theory of relativity), works of fiction (e.g., Dante’s Inferno), fictional characters (e.g., Bilbo Baggins) or conventional entities  are abstract?\n It should be stressed that there may not be one single “correct” way of explaining the abstract/concrete distinction. Any plausible account will classify the paradigm cases in the standard way or give reasons for proceeding otherwise, and any interesting account will draw a clear and philosophically significant line in the domain of objects. Yet there may be many equally interesting ways of accomplishing these two goals, and if we find ourselves with two or more accounts that do the job rather well, there may be no point in asking which corresponds to the real abstract/concrete distinction. This illustrates a general point: when technical terminology is introduced in philosophy by means of examples, but without explicit definition or theoretical elaboration, the resulting vocabulary is often vague or indeterminate in reference. In such cases, it usually is pointless to seek a single correct account. A philosopher may find herself asking questions like, ‘What is idealism?’ or ‘What is a substance?’ and treating these questions as difficult questions about the underlying nature of a certain determinate philosophical category. A better approach may be to recognize that in many cases of this sort, we simply have not made up our minds about how the term is to be understood, and that what we seek is not a precise account of what this term already means, but rather a proposal for how it might fruitfully be used for philosophical analysis. Anyone who believes that something in the vicinity of the abstract/concrete distinction matters for philosophy would be well advised to approach the project of explaining the distinction with this in mind.\n So before we turn to the discussion of abstract objects in earnest, it will help if we clarify how some of the key terms will be used in what follows.'];That's a fascinating question.

This perspective argues that these abstract entities are not just human constructs, but realities themselves.;So, platonism is saying that numbers are like this separate realm of existence?

['The abstract/concrete distinction has a curious status in contemporary philosophy. It is widely agreed that the ontological distinction is of fundamental importance, but as yet, there is no standard account of how it should be drawn. There is a consensus about how to classify certain paradigm cases. For example, it is usually acknowledged that numbers and the other objects of pure mathematics, like pure sets, are abstract (if they exist), whereas rocks, trees, and human beings are concrete. In everyday language, it is common to use expressions that refer to concrete entities as well as those that apparently refer to abstractions such as democracy, happiness, motherhood, etc. Moreover, formulations of mathematical theories seem to appeal directly to abstract entities, and the use of mathematical expressions in the empirical sciences seems indispensable to the formulation of our best empirical theories .  Finally, apparent reference to abstract entities such as sets, properties, concepts, propositions, types, and possible worlds, among others, is ubiquitous in different areas of philosophy.\n Though there is a pervasive appeal to abstract objects, philosophers have nevertheless wondered whether they exist. The alternatives are: platonism, which endorses their existence, and nominalism, which denies the existence of abstract objects across the board. (See the entries on  nominalism in metaphysics  and  platonism in metaphysics.)  But the question of how to draw the distinction between abstract and concrete objects is an open one: it is not clear how one should characterize these two categories nor is there a definite list of items that fall under one or the other category (assuming neither is empty).\n The first challenge, then, is to articulate the distinction, either by defining the terms explicitly or by embedding them in a theory that makes their connections to other important categories more explicit. In the absence of such an account, the philosophical significance of the contrast remains uncertain, for the attempt to classify things as abstract or concrete by appeal to intuition is often problematic. Is it clear that scientific theories (e.g., the general theory of relativity), works of fiction (e.g., Dante’s Inferno), fictional characters (e.g., Bilbo Baggins) or conventional entities  are abstract?\n It should be stressed that there may not be one single “correct” way of explaining the abstract/concrete distinction. Any plausible account will classify the paradigm cases in the standard way or give reasons for proceeding otherwise, and any interesting account will draw a clear and philosophically significant line in the domain of objects. Yet there may be many equally interesting ways of accomplishing these two goals, and if we find ourselves with two or more accounts that do the job rather well, there may be no point in asking which corresponds to the real abstract/concrete distinction. This illustrates a general point: when technical terminology is introduced in philosophy by means of examples, but without explicit definition or theoretical elaboration, the resulting vocabulary is often vague or indeterminate in reference.

How do they fit into this idea of abstract objects?;['frege', 'famously', 'distinguish', 'mutually', 'exclusive', 'ontological', 'domain', 'function', 'object', 'accord', 'view', 'function', 'incomplete', 'entity', 'map', 'argument', 'value', 'denote', 'incomplete', 'expression', 'object', 'complete', 'entity', 'denote', 'singular', 'term', 'frege', 'reduce', 'property', 'relation', 'function', 'entity', 'include', 'object', 'author', 'use', 'frege', 'notion', 'object', 'discuss', 'abstract', 'object', 'frege', 'sense', 'object', 'important', 'way', 'use', 'term', 'philosopher', 'include', 'property', 'relation', 'abstract', 'object', 'background', 'context', 'discuss', 'object', 'type', 'theory', 'property', 'relation', 'high', 'type', 'property', 'property', 'property', 'relation', 'consider', 'object', 'use', 'object', 'interchangeable', 'entity', 'entry', 'follow', 'usage', 'treat', 'expression', 'object', 'entity', 'have', 'meaning', 'discussion', 'entry', 'object'];['raise', 'great', 'point', 'fact', 'philosopher', 'like', 'frege', 'argue', 'property', 'relation', 'like', 'function', 'incomplete', 'sense', 'apply', 'object', 'function', 'type', 'abstract', 'object', 'albeit', 'different', 'number', 'idea'];['thing', 'like', 'property', 'relation', 'like', 'action', 'way', 'thing', 'interact', 'fit', 'idea', 'abstract', 'object']
['\n Frege famously distinguished two mutually exclusive ontological domains, functions and objects. According to his view, a function is an ‘incomplete’ entity that maps arguments to values, and is denoted by an incomplete expression, whereas an object is a ‘complete’ entity and can be denoted by a singular term. Frege reduced properties and relations to functions and so these entities are not included among the objects. Some authors make use of Frege’s notion of ‘object’ when discussing abstract objects . But though Frege’s sense of ‘object’ is important, it is not the only way to use the term. Other philosophers include properties and relations among the abstract objects. And when the background context for discussing objects is type theory, properties and relations of higher type (e.g., properties of properties, and properties of relations) may be all be considered ‘objects’.

(For further discussion, see the entry on  objects.)'];Exactly. And this is where the concept of type theory comes into play. In type theory, these functions can be treated as objects, just like numbers or ideas, but with different properties and relations. For instance, a property of a property can be seen as a higher-order function, which is still an abstract object, but one that operates on other abstract objects. Think of it like Russian nesting dolls – each one can be considered a complete entity, but they also contain other entities within them.;So, it's like... if we have a function that describes a shape, it's not just an action, but an actual thing that has properties, like the shape being circular or triangular?;['frege', 'famously', 'distinguish', 'mutually', 'exclusive', 'ontological', 'domain', 'function', 'object', 'accord', 'view', 'function', 'incomplete', 'entity', 'map', 'argument', 'value', 'denote', 'incomplete', 'expression', 'object', 'complete', 'entity', 'denote', 'singular', 'term', 'frege', 'reduce', 'property', 'relation', 'function', 'entity', 'include', 'object', 'author', 'use', 'frege', 'notion', 'object', 'discuss', 'abstract', 'object', 'frege', 'sense', 'object', 'important', 'way', 'use', 'term', 'philosopher', 'include', 'property', 'relation', 'abstract', 'object', 'background', 'context', 'discuss', 'object', 'type', 'theory', 'property', 'relation', 'high', 'type', 'property', 'property', 'property', 'relation', 'consider', 'object', 'use', 'object', 'interchangeable', 'entity', 'entry', 'follow', 'usage', 'treat', 'expression', 'object', 'entity', 'have', 'meaning', 'discussion', 'entry', 'object'];['exactly', 'concept', 'type', 'theory', 'come', 'play', 'type', 'theory', 'function', 'treat', 'object', 'like', 'number', 'idea', 'different', 'property', 'relation', 'instance', 'property', 'property', 'see', 'high', 'order', 'function', 'abstract', 'object', 'operate', 'abstract', 'object', 'think', 'like', 'russian', 'nesting', 'doll', 'consider', 'complete', 'entity', 'contain', 'entity'];['like', 'function', 'describe', 'shape', 'action', 'actual', 'thing', 'property', 'like', 'shape', 'circular', 'triangular']

For example, when mathematicians take set and membership as primitives and then assert some principles of set theory, they often illustrate their primitives by offering some examples of sets, such as The Undergraduate Class of 2020 or The Ethics Committee, etc. But these, of course, aren’t quite right, since the members of the class and committee may change while the class and committee remain the same, whereas if the members of a set change, one has a different set. A similar concern affects the present proposal. If one offers sets or the characters of the Sherlock Holmes novels as examples to help motivate the primitive concept abstract object, then one has to wonder about impure sets such as the unit set whose sole member is Aristotle (i.e., \\(\\{\\textrm{Aristotle}\\}\\)) and the object London that appears in the novels.'];That's a tempting approach, often called primitivism. By taking abstract and concrete as primitive notions, we might be able to define other interesting predicates and make claims about them. However, this approach has its own set of challenges. For one, it's not always easy to come up with intuitive instances of these primitive notions. Moreover, even if we do, we risk running into problems similar to the one we encountered with impure sets. For example, if we take sets as primitive and use them to illustrate abstract entities, we might struggle to account for impure sets that seem to blur the line between abstract and concrete.;But isn't that just a problem with our definitions? If we can't define abstract and concrete entities clearly, can't we just take them as primitive notions and work from there?;['accord', 'way', 'example', 'suffice', 'list', 'paradigm', 'case', 'abstract', 'concrete', 'entity', 'hope', 'sense', 'distinction', 'emerge', 'clearly', 'list', 'example', 'category', 'heuristically', 'promising', 'start', 'search', 'criterion', 'list', 'criterion', 'fruitful', 'draw', 'distinction', 'simple', 'list', 'limited', 'significance', 'way', 'extrapolate', 'paradigm', 'case', 'distinction', 'cover', 'unclear', 'case', 'result', 'clear', 'notion', 'example', 'pure', 'set', 'paradigm', 'example', 'abstract', 'entity', 'case', 'impure', 'set', 'far', 'clear', 'consider', 'unit', 'set', 'sole', 'member', 'joe', 'biden', 'joe', 'biden', 'undergraduate', 'class', 'ethics', 'committee', 'etc', 'set', 'clear', 'abstract', 'give', 'joe', 'biden', 'member', 'class', 'committee', 'concrete', 'similarly', 'offer', 'character', 'sherlock', 'holmes', 'story', 'example', 'help', 'motivate', 'primitive', 'concept', 'abstract', 'object', 'wonder', 'object', 'london', 'appear', 'refusal', 'characterize', 'abstract', 'concrete', 'distinction', 'maintain', 'category', 'instance', 'call', 'way', 'primitivism', 'following', 'condition', 'obtain', 'predicate', 'distinguish', 'primitive', 'unanalyzable', 'explanatory', 'power', 'rest', 'fact', 'interesting', 'predicate', 'define', 'term', 'primitive', 'interesting', 'claim', 'judge', 'true', 'basis', 'intuitive', 'understanding', 'primitive', 'define', 'notion', 'abstract', 'concrete', 'primitive', 'notion', 'insignificant', 'result', 'use', 'strategy', 'explain', 'abstract', 'object', 'necessarily', 'existent', 'causally', 'ineffiacious', 'non', 'spatiotemporal', 'intersubjective', 'etc', 'close', 'inspection', 'method', 'reveal', 'significant', 'concern', 'start', 'distinction', 'take', 'basic', 'unanalyzable', 'typically', 'offer', 'intuitive', 'instance', 'primitive', 'predicate', 'easy', 'example', 'mathematician', 'set', 'membership', 'primitive', 'assert', 'principle', 'set', 'theory', 'illustrate', 'primitive', 'offer', 'example', 'set', 'undergraduate', 'class', 'ethics', 'committee', 'etc', 'course', 'right', 'member', 'class', 'committee', 'change', 'class', 'committee', 'remain', 'member', 'set', 'change', 'different', 'set', 'similar', 'concern', 'affect', 'present', 'proposal', 'offer', 'set', 'character', 'sherlock', 'holmes', 'novel', 'example', 'help', 'motivate', 'primitive', 'concept', 'abstract', 'object', 'wonder', 'impure', 'set', 'unit', 'set', 'sole', 'member', 'aristotle', 'object', 'london', 'appear', 'novel'];['tempting', 'approach', 'call', 'primitivism', 'take', 'abstract', 'concrete', 'primitive', 'notion', 'able', 'define', 'interesting', 'predicate', 'claim', 'approach', 'set', 'challenge', 'easy', 'come', 'intuitive', 'instance', 'primitive', 'notion', 'risk', 'run', 'problem', 'similar', 'encounter', 'impure', 'set', 'example', 'set', 'primitive', 'use', 'illustrate', 'abstract', 'entity', 'struggle', 'account', 'impure', 'set', 'blur', 'line', 'abstract', 'concrete'];['problem', 'definition', 'define', 'abstract', 'concrete', 'entity', 'clearly', 'primitive', 'notion', 'work']
"['\n Another methodology is what Lewis calls the way of abstraction. According to a longstanding tradition in philosophical psychology, abstraction is a distinctive mental process in which new ideas or conceptions are formed by considering the common features of several objects or ideas and ignoring the irrelevant features that distinguish those objects. For example, if one is given a range of white things of varying shapes and sizes; one ignores or abstracts from the respects in which they differ, and thereby attains the abstract idea of whiteness. Nothing in this tradition requires that ideas formed in this way represent or correspond to a distinctive kind of object. But it might be maintained that the distinction between abstract and concrete objects should be explained by reference to the psychological process of abstraction or something like it. The simplest version of this strategy would be to say that an object is abstract if it is (or might be) the referent of an abstract idea; i.e., an idea formed by abstraction.

A map is created to represent the layout of the land, but the land itself existed before the map. Similarly, numbers can be seen as a tool we create to represent quantities and relationships.

One way to approach this is by thinking about abstraction. Imagine you're looking at a group of different objects, all of which are white but vary in shape and size. If you ignore their differences and focus on their shared whiteness, you're forming an abstract idea. Some philosophers argue that numbers can be understood in this way, as abstract ideas formed by considering the common features of various quantities. But this raises the question of whether such abstraction gives rise to a distinct, abstract realm.;I see what you mean. But what about the idea that numbers have an abstract existence?

"['\n In §3, we passed over without comment the parenthetical phrase from Quine’s characterization of essentialism. Adding that phrase to the first view of essentialism from §3 yields:\n essentialism is the doctrine that (at least some) objects have independently of how they are referred to (at least some) essential properties.\n\n The added phrase stresses that the essentialist thinks that it at least makes sense to ask of an object (“in itself”) whether it must have a particular property. Skeptics about essentialism have doubted the very intelligibility of such a question. Here is one prominent thought behind such anti-essentialism.  Since it is necessary that seven plus two is greater than seven, when the number nine is referred to as ‘seven plus two’ it is essentially greater than seven. But, since it is not necessary that the number of planets is greater than seven, when the number nine is referred to as ‘the number of planets’ it is not essentially greater than seven. The point is supposed to be that it makes no sense to say of the number nine, independently of any way of referring to it, that it is or is not essentially greater than seven. Similarly, an anti-essentialist might say that when a person who is both a mathematician and a cyclist is thought of as a mathematician, being rational is essential to him, while being two-legged is not; but when the very same person is thought of as a cyclist, then although being two-legged is essential to him, being rational is not. Again, the point is supposed to be that it makes no sense to say of the very person who is the mathematical cyclist, independently of any way of thinking about him, that he is or is not essentially rational (or two-legged). According to the anti-essentialist, asking whether Andrew Wiles (who we may suppose is a cycling mathematician) could fail to be rational is like asking whether Andrew Wiles is taller than—both questions demand another relatum. Could he fail to be rational, relative to what way of referring to him? Is he taller than whom?\n In response the essentialist will point out that the anti-essentialist’s thought does not square very well with intuition. Consider the object that is referred to by all these phrases: ‘nine’, ‘seven plus two’, ‘the number of planets’. Could that very object have failed to be greater than seven? Intuitively the question seems intelligible, and the answer seems to be that it could not have failed to be greater than seven. According to intuition then, the very object that is referred to by ‘the number of planets’ (which is the very same object that is referred to by ‘seven plus two’ and ‘nine’) is essentially greater than seven. Intuition also has it that the claim that the number of planets is greater than seven is not itself necessary. To add some jargon: Intuition has it that the claim that it is necessary that the number of planets is greater than seven is true read de re (“of the thing”), but false read de dicto (“of the dictum” or “of the statement”). (The de re reading is this: the number of planets has the property of being necessarily greater than seven. The de dicto reading is this: the claim that the number of planets is greater than seven has the property of being necessary.) The essentialist is pointing out that the anti-essentialist’s argument asserts that the latter intuition undermines the former, but does not say why.']";That's a fascinating question. I'll use an analogy to clarify this: think of a person's essential properties as a set of underlying musical notes, while how they're referred to is like different songs that use those same notes.

"['\n In §3, we passed over without comment the parenthetical phrase from Quine’s characterization of essentialism. Adding that phrase to the first view of essentialism from §3 yields:\n essentialism is the doctrine that (at least some) objects have independently of how they are referred to (at least some) essential properties.\n\n The added phrase stresses that the essentialist thinks that it at least makes sense to ask of an object (“in itself”) whether it must have a particular property. Skeptics about essentialism have doubted the very intelligibility of such a question. Here is one prominent thought behind such anti-essentialism.  Since it is necessary that seven plus two is greater than seven, when the number nine is referred to as ‘seven plus two’ it is essentially greater than seven. But, since it is not necessary that the number of planets is greater than seven, when the number nine is referred to as ‘the number of planets’ it is not essentially greater than seven. The point is supposed to be that it makes no sense to say of the number nine, independently of any way of referring to it, that it is or is not essentially greater than seven. Similarly, an anti-essentialist might say that when a person who is both a mathematician and a cyclist is thought of as a mathematician, being rational is essential to him, while being two-legged is not; but when the very same person is thought of as a cyclist, then although being two-legged is essential to him, being rational is not. Again, the point is supposed to be that it makes no sense to say of the very person who is the mathematical cyclist, independently of any way of thinking about him, that he is or is not essentially rational (or two-legged). According to the anti-essentialist, asking whether Andrew Wiles (who we may suppose is a cycling mathematician) could fail to be rational is like asking whether Andrew Wiles is taller than—both questions demand another relatum. Could he fail to be rational, relative to what way of referring to him? Is he taller than whom?\n In response the essentialist will point out that the anti-essentialist’s thought does not square very well with intuition. Consider the object that is referred to by all these phrases: ‘nine’, ‘seven plus two’, ‘the number of planets’. Could that very object have failed to be greater than seven? Intuitively the question seems intelligible, and the answer seems to be that it could not have failed to be greater than seven. According to intuition then, the very object that is referred to by ‘the number of planets’ (which is the very same object that is referred to by ‘seven plus two’ and ‘nine’) is essentially greater than seven. Intuition also has it that the claim that the number of planets is greater than seven is not itself necessary. To add some jargon: Intuition has it that the claim that it is necessary that the number of planets is greater than seven is true read de re (“of the thing”), but false read de dicto (“of the dictum” or “of the statement”). (The de re reading is this: the number of planets has the property of being necessarily greater than seven. The de dicto reading is this: the claim that the number of planets is greater than seven has the property of being necessary.) The essentialist is pointing out that the anti-essentialist’s argument asserts that the latter intuition undermines the former, but does not say why.']";That's exactly the kind of counterargument that skeptics of essentialism would raise. They'd say that what's essential to someone or something depends on how we're thinking about them. But essentialists would counter that just because our way of thinking about something changes, it doesn't mean that the thing itself has changed. To use the music analogy again, just because we're playing a different song using the same notes, it doesn't mean that the notes themselves have changed. Consider the number nine: whether we refer to it as 'seven plus two' or 'the number of planets', it still has the same underlying properties.;But what if the way they're referred to actually changes their essential properties?

['\n Assuming that we have knowledge of some essentialist claims, how might we account for that knowledge?

The first example is different from the last two in that it seems that we can know a priori that being such that there are infinitely many primes is essential to Socrates whereas it seems that we can know only a posteriori that being human and originating from \\(s\\) and \\(e\\) are also essential to him.\n While it is a vexed philosophical issue just how to account for a priori knowledge of necessary truths such as logical truths, mathematical truths, and the homelier necessary truths like the truth that nothing can be red all over and green all over at the same time, accounting for our knowledge of the necessary truth that Socrates is such that there are infinitely many primes, does not seem to be problematic in some extra special way. If we had a good account of our a priori knowledge of the necessary truth that there are infinitely many primes, then it would take little more to account for our knowledge of the necessary truth about Socrates that he is such that there are infinitely many primes.\n Kripke  suggests that our knowledge of some other essentialist claims is based in part on a bit of a priori knowledge and in part on a bit of empirical knowledge.

To illustrate this, think of a math problem. You might use logical reasoning to derive the solution, but you also need to understand the definitions and axioms that underlie the math. In the case of essentialism, we use a priori knowledge to understand concepts like origin and kind, and then combine that with empirical knowledge about the person or object in question. For example, we might use our a priori knowledge that every organism has its origin essentially, and then empirically verify that Socrates originated from sperm s and egg e.;That makes sense.

For the purposes of the present discussion, let us assume that we know that being such that there are infinitely many primes, being human, and originating from sperm \\(s\\) and egg \\(e\\) are essential properties of Socrates. The first example is different from the last two in that it seems that we can know a priori that being such that there are infinitely many primes is essential to Socrates whereas it seems that we can know only a posteriori that being human and originating from \\(s\\) and \\(e\\) are also essential to him.\n While it is a vexed philosophical issue just how to account for a priori knowledge of necessary truths such as logical truths, mathematical truths, and the homelier necessary truths like the truth that nothing can be red all over and green all over at the same time, accounting for our knowledge of the necessary truth that Socrates is such that there are infinitely many primes, does not seem to be problematic in some extra special way. If we had a good account of our a priori knowledge of the necessary truth that there are infinitely many primes, then it would take little more to account for our knowledge of the necessary truth about Socrates that he is such that there are infinitely many primes.\n Kripke  suggests that our knowledge of some other essentialist claims is based in part on a bit of a priori knowledge and in part on a bit of empirical knowledge. For example, our knowledge that originating from \\(s\\) and \\(e\\) is essential to Socrates is based in part on our a priori knowledge that every organism has its origin essentially and in part on our empirical knowledge that Socrates (is an organism that) originated from \\(s\\) and \\(e\\). (Similarly our knowledge that Socrates is essentially human appears to be based in part on our a priori knowledge that everything has its kind essentially and in part on our empirical knowledge that Socrates is (of the kind) human.) Thus, our knowledge of the claim that originating from \\(s\\) and \\(e\\) is essential to Socrates should be no more problematic epistemologically than our knowledge of the two claims on which it is based and our knowledge of the validity of the argument from those two claims. As we have already mentioned, although there are difficult philosophical issues concerning our knowledge of logical truths, our knowledge of the validity of the argument in question does not seem to add any special problems of its own. Similarly, although there are philosophical issues concerning empirical knowledge, our knowledge that Socrates originated from \\(s\\) and \\(e\\) does not appear to add any special problems. However our a priori knowledge that every organism has its origin essentially does seem to have special problems over and above the problems associated with accounting for our a priori knowledge of logic, mathematics, and the homelier necessary truths. The latter claims are generally supported by universally held intuitions or by arguments that are universally accepted whereas the former, like most philosophical claims, is supported by a less robust intuition and by a more controversial argument. To see in some detail how philosophers have gone about defending origin essentialism, see the\n  Supplement on Arguments for Origin Essentialism.  \n For more about arguments for sortal essentialism, see Wiggins  and Mackie . The entry on  the epistemology of modality  is useful on general issues in modal epistemology.'];Ah, this is where things get interesting. While some essentialist claims, like the necessity of logical truths, are widely accepted, others, like origin essentialism, are more contentious. In those cases, the a priori knowledge may be based on less robust intuitions and more controversial arguments. Think of it like building a tower of blocks. The lower blocks represent more widely accepted truths, while the higher blocks represent more speculative claims that are subject to greater debate. To justify our a priori knowledge of origin essentialism, we would need to provide additional arguments and evidence to support it.;I see what you mean.

"['\n Leibniz’s Law of the Indiscernibility of Identicals, according to which, if “two” things are identical, then they share all their properties, can be used to argue for various claims of nonidentity. If you know, for example, that Charles is a philosophy major and that Yoko is not, then you can safely infer that Charles is not identical to Yoko. Essentialist claims have played a role in some prominent Leibniz Law arguments for nonidentity theses. A certain brand of mind-body dualism may be argued for in the following way: \\(X\\) is essentially a thinking thing; \\(X\\)’s body is not essentially a thinking thing; so \\(X\\) is not (identical to) \\(X\\)’s body. A similar argument can be given for the conclusion that a statue is not identical with the lump of material (wax, clay, marble, or what have you) that constitutes it. Consider a human-shaped statue—call it ‘Goliath’—and the lump of wax that composes it—call it ‘Lump\\(_1\\)’. Goliath, we may imagine, is throughout its entire existence composed of Lump\\(_1\\) while Lump\\(_1\\) throughout its entire existence composes Goliath. In this case, Goliath and Lump\\(_1\\) are spatiotemporally colocated, which is just to say that they occupy the exact same spatial region at any given time whenever either of them exists. This being the case, they share most of their properties: Goliath weighs 17 kilograms and so does Lump\\(_1\\); Goliath has a white surface and so does Lump\\(_1\\); and so on. In fact, it may seem curious that we are writing as though there are two things at all. Why not say simply that Goliath and Lump\\(_1\\) are identical? Well, it at least seems that a pretty straightforward argument—one that relies on essentialist claims—establishes their nonidentity:\n The plausibility of the two premises seems undeniable, given that we think, for example, that if the room containing Goliath/Lump\\(_1\\) were to get really hot (hot enough to melt the wax) and then to cool again (so that what was left was a lump of wax in the shape of something like a mountain), then Goliath would be destroyed while Lump\\(_1\\) would still exist. And the reasoning looks impeccable: if Goliath were Lump\\(_1\\), then each would have to have all of the same properties as “the other”; since they have different properties, they must not be identical. (Few things in philosophy are as uncontroversial as Leibniz’s Law of the Indiscernibility of Identicals, though there has been some dispute about the proper way of formulating it.) Figuring out how to reconcile our intuitions that (1) and (2) are true with our tendency to think that Goliath and Lump\\(_1\\) are not really two things but just one is a version of the problem of material constitution. There are a wide variety of ways to deal with this problem. A “two-thinger”—one who thinks that there really are two things, a statue and a lump of wax, in one location—may simply eschew the tendency to identify Goliath and Lump\\(_1\\). Other responses suggest that there is something amiss with Leibniz Law arguments for nonidentities when there is this kind of an appeal to essential properties: Della Rocca  holds that such arguments are question begging; Lewis  and Noonan  hold that they are invalid; and Burke  and Rea  hold that in any such argument, at least one of the premises is false.

But what's interesting is when things have conflicting properties – like the wax having the potential to be both Phil Wax and just a lump of wax after melting. If we believe, like many people do, that something can't be ""destroyed"" just by changing shape, then maybe the wax has a more fundamental identity than the one we give it (Phil Wax). But this creates tension between the thing itself (the wax), and the identity that comes with it having a certain form (the shaped wax, or Phil Wax). That's where philosophers like Leibniz and others have argued that we can't reduce identity down to just a thing's characteristics, because sometimes those characteristics can contradict each other, or even change.";That's a confusing example, but also kind of cool.

"['\n Leibniz’s Law of the Indiscernibility of Identicals, according to which, if “two” things are identical, then they share all their properties, can be used to argue for various claims of nonidentity. If you know, for example, that Charles is a philosophy major and that Yoko is not, then you can safely infer that Charles is not identical to Yoko. Essentialist claims have played a role in some prominent Leibniz Law arguments for nonidentity theses. A certain brand of mind-body dualism may be argued for in the following way: \\(X\\) is essentially a thinking thing; \\(X\\)’s body is not essentially a thinking thing; so \\(X\\) is not (identical to) \\(X\\)’s body. A similar argument can be given for the conclusion that a statue is not identical with the lump of material (wax, clay, marble, or what have you) that constitutes it. Consider a human-shaped statue—call it ‘Goliath’—and the lump of wax that composes it—call it ‘Lump\\(_1\\)’. Goliath, we may imagine, is throughout its entire existence composed of Lump\\(_1\\) while Lump\\(_1\\) throughout its entire existence composes Goliath. In this case, Goliath and Lump\\(_1\\) are spatiotemporally colocated, which is just to say that they occupy the exact same spatial region at any given time whenever either of them exists. This being the case, they share most of their properties: Goliath weighs 17 kilograms and so does Lump\\(_1\\); Goliath has a white surface and so does Lump\\(_1\\); and so on. In fact, it may seem curious that we are writing as though there are two things at all. Why not say simply that Goliath and Lump\\(_1\\) are identical? Well, it at least seems that a pretty straightforward argument—one that relies on essentialist claims—establishes their nonidentity:\n The plausibility of the two premises seems undeniable, given that we think, for example, that if the room containing Goliath/Lump\\(_1\\) were to get really hot (hot enough to melt the wax) and then to cool again (so that what was left was a lump of wax in the shape of something like a mountain), then Goliath would be destroyed while Lump\\(_1\\) would still exist. And the reasoning looks impeccable: if Goliath were Lump\\(_1\\), then each would have to have all of the same properties as “the other”; since they have different properties, they must not be identical. (Few things in philosophy are as uncontroversial as Leibniz’s Law of the Indiscernibility of Identicals, though there has been some dispute about the proper way of formulating it.) Figuring out how to reconcile our intuitions that (1) and (2) are true with our tendency to think that Goliath and Lump\\(_1\\) are not really two things but just one is a version of the problem of material constitution. There are a wide variety of ways to deal with this problem. A “two-thinger”—one who thinks that there really are two things, a statue and a lump of wax, in one location—may simply eschew the tendency to identify Goliath and Lump\\(_1\\). Other responses suggest that there is something amiss with Leibniz Law arguments for nonidentities when there is this kind of an appeal to essential properties: Della Rocca  holds that such arguments are question begging; Lewis  and Noonan  hold that they are invalid; and Burke  and Rea  hold that in any such argument, at least one of the premises is false. For those who are interested, Rea  is a good place to start to delve more deeply into this problem.']";You're really getting into the thick of it. Well, some philosophers do argue that. They think that, yes, Goliath the statue and the lump of wax that makes it up are both real things, but they're different – they just happen to exist in the same place, and sometimes we use the same name (Goliath) to refer to both. While others argue that these identities aren't mutually exclusive – that a lump of wax can indeed be a statue at the same time, because something's properties (like being wax) can coexist with something's form (being Goliath) and shape (the statue).;And if that's the case, does that mean we should think that things can have multiple identities?;['leibniz', 'law', 'indiscernibility', 'identicals', 'accord', 'thing', 'identical', 'share', 'property', 'argue', 'claim', 'nonidentity', 'know', 'example', 'charles', 'philosophy', 'major', 'yoko', 'safely', 'infer', 'charles', 'identical', 'yoko', 'essentialist', 'claim', 'play', 'role', 'prominent', 'leibniz', 'law', 'argument', 'nonidentity', 'thesis', 'certain', 'brand', 'mind', 'body', 'dualism', 'argue', 'following', 'way', 'essentially', 'thinking', 'thing', 'body', 'essentially', 'thinking', 'thing', 'identical', 'body', 'similar', 'argument', 'give', 'conclusion', 'statue', 'identical', 'lump', 'material', 'wax', 'clay', 'marble', 'constitute', 'consider', 'human', 'shape', 'statue', 'lump', 'wax', 'compose', 'goliath', 'imagine', 'entire', 'existence', 'compose', 'entire', 'existence', 'compose', 'goliath', 'case', 'goliath', 'spatiotemporally', 'colocate', 'occupy', 'exact', 'spatial', 'region', 'give', 'time', 'exist', 'case', 'share', 'property', 'goliath', 'weigh', 'kilogram', 'goliath', 'white', 'surface', 'fact', 'curious', 'write', 'thing', 'simply', 'goliath', 'identical', 'pretty', 'straightforward', 'argument', 'rely', 'essentialist', 'claim', 'establish', 'plausibility', 'premise', 'undeniable', 'give', 'think', 'example', 'room', 'contain', 'goliath', 'hot', 'hot', 'melt', 'wax', 'cool', 'leave', 'lump', 'wax', 'shape', 'like', 'mountain', 'goliath', 'destroy', 'exist', 'reasoning', 'look', 'impeccable', 'goliath', 'property', 'different', 'property', 'identical', 'thing', 'philosophy', 'uncontroversial', 'leibniz', 'law', 'indiscernibility', 'identicals', 'dispute', 'proper', 'way', 'formulate', 'figure', 'reconcile', 'intuition', 'true', 'tendency', 'think', 'goliath', 'thing', 'version', 'problem', 'material', 'constitution', 'wide', 'variety', 'way', 'deal', 'problem', 'think', 'thing', 'statue', 'lump', 'wax', 'location', 'simply', 'eschew', 'tendency', 'identify', 'goliath', 'response', 'suggest', 'amiss', 'leibniz', 'law', 'argument', 'nonidentitie', 'kind', 'appeal', 'essential', 'property', 'della', 'rocca', 'hold', 'argument', 'question', 'beg', 'lewis', 'noonan', 'hold', 'invalid', 'burke', 'rea', 'hold', 'argument', 'premise', 'false', 'interested', 'rea', 'good', 'place', 'start', 'delve', 'deeply', 'problem'];['get', 'thick', 'philosopher', 'argue', 'think', 'yes', 'goliath', 'statue', 'lump', 'wax', 'make', 'real', 'thing', 'different', 'happen', 'exist', 'place', 'use', 'goliath', 'refer', 'argue', 'identity', 'mutually', 'exclusive', 'lump', 'wax', 'statue', 'time', 'property', 'like', 'wax', 'coexist', 'form', 'goliath', 'shape', 'statue'];['case', 'mean', 'think', 'thing', 'multiple', 'identity']

Let me use an analogy to help clarify the distinction.

Both involve objects in motion, but one is guided by our intentions, while the other isn't. In the case of the brush stroke, the painter's movement isn't just an automatic response – they're using the motion to achieve a specific artistic effect. Our arm raising can be seen in a similar light; we're intentionally moving our arm to accomplish something.";Professor Phil, I've been reading some philosophy of action lately, and I'm having trouble understanding why our arm moving versus us raising our arm are different actions.

Let's play devil's advocate for a moment. Suppose someone tickles you while you're asleep, and your arm moves involuntarily. You have no conscious intention to move your arm, but some might argue that there's still an underlying neural process or 'desire' at play. Does that count as an intention? To complicate matters further, some philosophers argue that focusing on internal mental states, like desires or intentions, isn't the best way to understand actions. They propose looking at the external, observable aspects of intentional behavior instead.

"['The central question in philosophy of action is standardly taken to be: “What makes something an action?” However, we obtain different versions of the question depending on what we take as the contrast class from which actions are to be differentiated. The different questions in turn encode important presuppositions. First, we may understand the question as asking us to differentiate between intentional action and the notions of acting and activity considered above . Most commonly, however, the question is taken in terms of Wittgenstein’s classic formulation: “What is left over if I subtract the fact that my arm goes up from the fact that I raise my arm?” . A common, though contested, reading of this passage is this: there are certain events of an arm’s going up that are actions, and some that are not (e.g. if someone tickles me in my sleep). What further factor does the action have that the event resulting from tickling lacks?\n Many historical as well as contemporary thinkers hope to answer just this question. A simple answer, common in the early modern period , is that what distinguishes actions from other events is that they are the causal outcomes of desires, volitions, or acts of will. A modern version of this view, considered below, appeals instead to intentions, regarded as distinctive mental states. Despite the intuitiveness of these “standard” answers, there have been increasing worries that they are based on disputable assumptions. First, there is an assumption about the metaphysical category to which actions belong. Although it is natural to take them as events, some philosophers have argued that there are good reasons to group them under a different category. Second, the common reading of Wittgenstein’s question presupposes what has been called “additive” or “decompositional” conceptions of action : it is assumed that an account of action can be given in terms of distinct, and simpler components. However, a number of authors have argued that this reductive project is bound to fail .\n It has also been contended that philosophers who offer the standard answers make important methodological assumptions. These philosophers approach questions about agency as though they were on par with scientific questions to this extent: they seek mechanistic, or causal explanations of agency, explanations that can be grasped from an objective perspective. However, drawing inspiration from Kant, some philosophers contend that philosophy of action should be done from the agential perspective ; and other philosophers drawing from Aristotle and Frege have argued for similar views . From a different standpoint, the standard methodology has been criticized as not being scientific enough. It has been argued that certain empirical results disprove some of the basic assumptions behind these answers. For example, Libet’s experiments have been taken to suggest that intentions are causally ineffective, and that to understand the true causes of action we would have to focus on neural processes (‘action potentials’) about which we could only learn through standard scientific methods . Although these radical views are now widely held to be based on faulty conceptual and empirical grounds , surprising scientific results continue to challenge commonly held views in philosophy of action .\n In this entry we draw from the work of philosophers working through different methodological paradigms. We will not bring up these differences again, but they may be worth keeping in mind as we consider the various debates below.']";Absolutely. While some might view his question as overly simplistic, I think it still gets at the heart of understanding what makes an action intentional. In fact, the disagreement among philosophers over how to address this question highlights the fruitfulness of exploring the complexities and nuances of human behavior. We're still grappling with Wittgenstein's question today, and for good reason – it has many tacit assumptions that imply a host of answers Кат challenge has radically reshaped the philosophical landscape.;I see what you mean now.

['\n Possibly the most widespread and accepted theory of intentional action (though by no means without its challengers) is the causal theory of action, a theory according to which something counts as an intentional action in virtue of its causal connection to certain mental states. In fact, this view is often dubbed  the ‘standard story of action’. Although other philosophers proposed similar views before, the contemporary causal theory of action, or “causalism,” was pioneered by Donald Davidson, especially the essays collected in Davidson . Davidson has contributed to many topics in the philosophy of action, such as action individuation, the logical form of action sentences, the relation between intention and evaluative judgments, among others, but here we will focus mostly on his arguments for, and his formulation of, the causal theory of action. In Action, Reasons, and Causes (ARC), Davidson provides an account of the nature of rationalizing explanations of actions, or what is often called ‘intentional explanations’. Such explanations explain the action by providing the reason why the agent acted. ARC tries to understand how a reason can explain an action. The two central theses of ARC, or modified versions of them, became subsequently widely, though certainly not universally, accepted. The first thesis is that the explanation of an action involves a “primary reason”: a belief and a desire pair that rationalizes the action by expressing the end pursued in the action (desire) and how the agent thought the action would accomplish this end (instrumental belief). So, for instance, in “Larry went to Gus the Barber because he wanted a haircut”, Larry’s action is explained by a desire (his wanting a haircut) and a belief, left implicit in this case (his believing that he could get a haircut by going to Gus the Barber). The second central thesis is that the primary reason is also the cause of the action.'];That's a great question. To break it down, consider this analogy: imagine you're driving a car. You're heading towards a destination, but there are many factors influencing your journey – the road signs, other drivers, even the GPS. Now, you might ask, 'Am I really in control, or am I just following the path set before me?' This is similar to the debate surrounding intentional action. One dominant theory, which we can call the 'standard story,' posits that our actions are the result of a causal connection to our mental states – our desires, beliefs, and intentions. In other words, your decision to come to this university might be seen as the result of a desire for a good education and a belief that this university would provide that.;Professor Phil, I'm thinking about why I decided to come to this university.

In your coffee example, your primary reason might be a desire for a stimulating drink and a belief that coffee would satisfy that desire. But, as you pointed out, we might also question whether these desires and beliefs are truly our own or if they're influenced by external factors.;But what about when I decide to grab a coffee?

"['\n Davidson’s view in ARC is presented against a number of philosophers (mostly influenced by Wittgenstein), who, on his view, take action explanations to provide a different kind of understanding than causal explanations . Some of the identified targets of the paper  are clearly arguing for the views Davidson rejects. Others  do not clearly embrace the theses Davidson objects to, or at least not all of them. These philosophers took intentional explanations to display how an action is made intelligible or justified. So Melden says that “citing a motive  a fuller characterization of the action; it  a better understanding of what the  is doing” . Similarly, Anscombe’s special sense of the question “Why?’, discussed below (section 4.1), is supposed to pick out the particular way in which actions are explained. This claim is not one that Davidson denies; according to Davidson, in intentional explanations, or ‘rationalizations’, ”the agent is shown in his Role of Rational Animal … There is an irreducible … sense in which every rationalization justifies: from the agent’s point of view there was, when he acted, something to be said for the action.“ . But Melden, and other Wittgensteineans, argue that this kind of explanation cannot be a causal explanation. Melden’s central argument is the ”logical connection“ argument. According to Melden, since the supposedly causal antecedents of an action (mental items such as desires and intentions) are logically related to the intentional action (I would not count as intentionally signalling a turn if I did not desire/intend to signal a turn), the explanation of the action in terms of such mental items cannot be an explanation in terms of ”Humean causes“. After all, Humean causation connects events that are logically independent.\n Davidson’s ARC exposes a crucial fallacy with Melden’s argument (similar problems had been pointed out by Annette Baier (then Annette Stoop) in Stoop 1962). Accepting Hume’s account of causal relations does not commit us to the view that any description of a cause is logically independent of any description of its effect. An event can only be described as ”sunburning“ if it is caused by exposure to the sun, but this does not mean that the cause of a sunburn is not a ”separate entity“ from the sunburn. We can describe an event as ”The event that caused X“ without thereby refuting Humeanism about causation. Davidson argues that, on the contrary, the mental items cited in an action explanation can only explain the action if they are also the cause of the action (the second central thesis of ARC). In our example above, Larry might have had other belief-desire pairs that rationalized his action of going to the barber. For instance, Larry might also have wanted a bottle of cream soda and believed that he could procure such an item at Gus the Barber. However, he did not (we may stipulate) go there because he wanted cream soda but because he wanted a haircut (and believed he could get one at Gus the Barber). The only way we can explain the difference between potentially rationalizing, but non-explanatory belief-desire pairs, is that the belief-desire pair that genuinely explains the action, the primary reason, also causes the action. The question of how non-causal theories can distinguish between merely potentially explanatory reasons for an action from the reasons that actually explain it became known as ”Davidson’s Challenge“ to non-causal theories of action .']";"Ah, that's an interesting question. Think of it like this: when you're driving a car and you turn the steering wheel to the left, we can explain that physically by the mechanics of the car and the laws of physics.

"['\n Davidson’s view in ARC is presented against a number of philosophers (mostly influenced by Wittgenstein), who, on his view, take action explanations to provide a different kind of understanding than causal explanations . Some of the identified targets of the paper  are clearly arguing for the views Davidson rejects. Others  do not clearly embrace the theses Davidson objects to, or at least not all of them. These philosophers took intentional explanations to display how an action is made intelligible or justified. So Melden says that “citing a motive  a fuller characterization of the action; it  a better understanding of what the  is doing” . Similarly, Anscombe’s special sense of the question “Why?’, discussed below (section 4.1), is supposed to pick out the particular way in which actions are explained. This claim is not one that Davidson denies; according to Davidson, in intentional explanations, or ‘rationalizations’, ”the agent is shown in his Role of Rational Animal … There is an irreducible … sense in which every rationalization justifies: from the agent’s point of view there was, when he acted, something to be said for the action.“ . But Melden, and other Wittgensteineans, argue that this kind of explanation cannot be a causal explanation. Melden’s central argument is the ”logical connection“ argument. According to Melden, since the supposedly causal antecedents of an action (mental items such as desires and intentions) are logically related to the intentional action (I would not count as intentionally signalling a turn if I did not desire/intend to signal a turn), the explanation of the action in terms of such mental items cannot be an explanation in terms of ”Humean causes“. After all, Humean causation connects events that are logically independent.\n Davidson’s ARC exposes a crucial fallacy with Melden’s argument (similar problems had been pointed out by Annette Baier (then Annette Stoop) in Stoop 1962). Accepting Hume’s account of causal relations does not commit us to the view that any description of a cause is logically independent of any description of its effect. An event can only be described as ”sunburning“ if it is caused by exposure to the sun, but this does not mean that the cause of a sunburn is not a ”separate entity“ from the sunburn. We can describe an event as ”The event that caused X“ without thereby refuting Humeanism about causation. Davidson argues that, on the contrary, the mental items cited in an action explanation can only explain the action if they are also the cause of the action (the second central thesis of ARC). In our example above, Larry might have had other belief-desire pairs that rationalized his action of going to the barber. For instance, Larry might also have wanted a bottle of cream soda and believed that he could procure such an item at Gus the Barber. However, he did not (we may stipulate) go there because he wanted cream soda but because he wanted a haircut (and believed he could get one at Gus the Barber). The only way we can explain the difference between potentially rationalizing, but non-explanatory belief-desire pairs, is that the belief-desire pair that genuinely explains the action, the primary reason, also causes the action. The question of how non-causal theories can distinguish between merely potentially explanatory reasons for an action from the reasons that actually explain it became known as ”Davidson’s Challenge“ to non-causal theories of action .']";Yes, that's true, and that's where things get tricky. Some philosophers, like David Hume, argued that causation is all about separate events being connected – like billiard balls hitting each other. But with mental states and actions, it's harder to separate the cause from the effect. Your brain state might be connected to your intention in a way that isn't just physical causation.;But doesn't the reason why I turned the wheel have something to do with physical brain states or something?

So, the real question is not whether reasons can be causes, but how we can tell which reasons are the actual causes?;['davidson', 'view', 'arc', 'present', 'number', 'philosopher', 'influence', 'wittgenstein', 'view', 'action', 'explanation', 'provide', 'different', 'kind', 'understanding', 'causal', 'explanation', 'identify', 'target', 'paper', 'clearly', 'argue', 'view', 'davidson', 'reject', 'clearly', 'embrace', 'thesis', 'davidson', 'object', 'philosopher', 'take', 'intentional', 'explanation', 'display', 'action', 'intelligible', 'justified', 'melden', 'say', 'cite', 'motive', 'full', 'characterization', 'action', 'well', 'understanding', 'similarly', 'anscombe', 'special', 'sense', 'question', 'discuss', 'section', 'suppose', 'pick', 'particular', 'way', 'action', 'explain', 'claim', 'davidson', 'deny', 'accord', 'davidson', 'intentional', 'explanation', 'rationalization', 'agent', 'show', 'role', 'rational', 'animal', 'irreducible', 'sense', 'rationalization', 'justify', 'agent', 'point', 'view', 'act', 'say', 'action', 'melden', 'wittgensteineans', 'argue', 'kind', 'explanation', 'causal', 'explanation', 'melden', 'central', 'argument', 'logical', 'connection', 'argument', 'accord', 'melden', 'supposedly', 'causal', 'antecedent', 'action', 'mental', 'item', 'desire', 'intention', 'logically', 'relate', 'intentional', 'action', 'count', 'intentionally', 'signal', 'turn', 'desire', 'intend', 'signal', 'turn', 'explanation', 'action', 'term', 'mental', 'item', 'explanation', 'term', 'humean', 'cause', 'humean', 'causation', 'connect', 'event', 'logically', 'davidson', 'arc', 'expose', 'crucial', 'fallacy', 'melden', 'argument', 'similar', 'problem', 'point', 'annette', 'baier', 'annette', 'stoop', 'stoop', 'accept', 'hume', 'account', 'causal', 'relation', 'commit', 'view', 'description', 'cause', 'logically', 'independent', 'description', 'effect', 'event', 'describe', 'sunburn', 'cause', 'exposure', 'sun', 'mean', 'cause', 'sunburn', 'separate', 'entity', 'sunburn', 'describe', 'event', 'event', 'cause', 'refute', 'humeanism', 'causation', 'davidson', 'argue', 'contrary', 'mental', 'item', 'cite', 'action', 'explanation', 'explain', 'action', 'cause', 'action', 'second', 'central', 'thesis', 'arc', 'example', 'larry', 'belief', 'desire', 'pair', 'rationalize', 'action', 'go', 'barber', 'instance', 'larry', 'want', 'bottle', 'cream', 'soda', 'believe', 'procure', 'item', 'gus', 'barber', 'stipulate', 'want', 'cream', 'soda', 'want', 'haircut', 'believe', 'gus', 'barber', 'way', 'explain', 'difference', 'potentially', 'rationalize', 'non', 'explanatory', 'belief', 'desire', 'pair', 'belief', 'desire', 'pair', 'genuinely', 'explain', 'action', 'primary', 'reason', 'cause', 'action', 'question', 'non', 'causal', 'theory', 'distinguish', 'merely', 'potentially', 'explanatory', 'reason', 'action', 'reason', 'actually', 'explain', 'know', 'davidson', 'challenge', 'non', 'causal', 'theory', 'action'];['exactly', 'davidson', 'argument', 'come', 'mental', 'item', 'cite', 'action', 'explanation', 'explain', 'action', 'cause', 'action'];['think', 'mean', 'real', 'question', 'reason', 'cause', 'tell', 'reason', 'actual', 'cause']
"['\n Although initially presented as an account of the nature of action explanation, Davidson’s account also contains the basic structure of an understanding of human action: according to Davidson, a true action statement (of the form ”x φ-ed“) denotes an event, and more specifically, a bodily movement. A bodily movement is an action if, and only if, the event is an intentional action . Davidson does not say this  explicitly,  but clearly on his view, an event is an intentional action under a certain description, if and only if, there is a true rationalizing explanation of the event under this description. Davidson  (following Anscombe) points out that ”x φ-ed intentionally“ creates an intensional context; that is whether an action is intentional depends on how the action is described. To use Davidson’s example, if I flip a switch, I also turn on the light, and alert the burglar. On Davidson’s view ”flipping the switch“, ”turning on the light“, and ”alerting the burglar“ are all descriptions of the same action. The ”accordion effect“ , characteristic of human action, makes it the case that the causal consequences of an intentional action provide further descriptions of human actions. If my flipping the switch caused the light to go on and the burglar to be alerted, then I also turned the light on and alerted the burglar. However, only the first two are intentional actions. On Davidson’s view, all these descriptions are descriptions of the same action; alerting the burglar is an action in virtue of the fact that these same bodily movements, under a different description, are a case of intentional action (flipping the switch). Thus Davidson concludes that, ”we never do more than move our bodies: the rest is up to nature“ .

However, I'd say it's more about how we choose to describe our actions. We might say that you intentionally turned the wheel, but that the startling of the pedestrian was just an unforeseen consequence. The question then becomes: what makes an action intentional, as opposed to just being a consequence of that action? That's where the debate between 'causalists' and others comes in, with some arguing that intentional action can be explained solely in terms of mental states and their causal effects, while others, like Davidson, are more skeptical about the possibility of such a reduction.;So, does that mean we can never really be sure what all the consequences of our actions are going to be?

"['\n The idea that an action is rationalized by its mental states is still very popular; much less so is the view that the only relevant states are beliefs and desires . As Bratman  argues, desires do not have the conduct-controlling and settling functions characteristic of intentions, and thus intentions seem to be better placed to be at the center of an account in which intentional actions are constituted by their causal genesis. My desire to have my teeth cleaned, when conjoined with my belief that in order to get my teeth cleaned I need to go to a dentist, will not result in my moving towards the dentist until I actually intend to go to the dentist. In fact, when Velleman comes to dub this kind of causal theory of action ”the standard story of action“, he explicitly describes the view as one in which intention plays a central role between the ”primary reason“ and the action. In the standard story, the agent’s ”desire for the end, and his belief in the action as a means … jointly cause an intention to take it, which in turn causes the corresponding movements of the agent’s body.“ . Davidson  himself came to accept that intentions play an important role in the causation and constitution of action and that intentions could not be reduced to beliefs or desires. But common to all these views is the idea that human actions are events that bear the right kind of causal relation to certain mental states or events of the agent that also explain the action.\n One alternative to the causal view understands agency as a form of irreducible agent-causation. Chisholm  presents a classic version of the view; Alvarez and Hyman  presents a radically different version which denies that agents cause the actions themselves; Mayr  develops a version of the view that, unlike Chisholm’s version, tries to show that human agency is not essentially different from other forms of substance causation that we find in the natural world. A second alternative sees intentional explanations as teleological rather than causal explanations ; that is, an intentional explanation cites the goal, the purpose, or the reason for which the agent acted rather than the antecedent causes of the action. Defenders of this view also try to provide an understanding of the teleological structure of intentional action that denies that teleological explanations reduce to causal explanations; they are instead a sui generis form of explanation. One way this view can meet Davidson’s Challenge is to argue that the truth of certain counterfactuals distinguishes potential reasons from the actual reasons. For instance, it could be true that even though the fact that the asparagus was delicious was a potential reason for Mary to eat asparagus, she would not have eaten them if they were not healthy and she would have eaten them even if they were not delicious ; such counterfactuals, on this view, are not grounded on causal relations between mental states and the bodily movements, but on the teleological structures that constitute intentional action. Finally, the causal account also contrasts with the neo-Aristotelian view in which human action is constituted, roughly, by a special form of practical knowledge ; on this view, in intentional action, ”knowledge is the  cause of what it understands“ (see section 4 of this entry).']";Not quite, my inquisitive student. While desires and beliefs do play a role in our decision-making, they aren't the entire story. Think of it like this: Imagine you're driving a car, and you want to get to your favorite restaurant. You believe that if you take a certain route, you'll get there. But, just having that desire and belief doesn't make the car move. You need to intend to drive to the restaurant, you need to make the conscious decision to put the car in gear and start moving. Intentions are what actually control and settle our actions.

"['\n The idea that an action is rationalized by its mental states is still very popular; much less so is the view that the only relevant states are beliefs and desires . As Bratman  argues, desires do not have the conduct-controlling and settling functions characteristic of intentions, and thus intentions seem to be better placed to be at the center of an account in which intentional actions are constituted by their causal genesis. My desire to have my teeth cleaned, when conjoined with my belief that in order to get my teeth cleaned I need to go to a dentist, will not result in my moving towards the dentist until I actually intend to go to the dentist. In fact, when Velleman comes to dub this kind of causal theory of action ”the standard story of action“, he explicitly describes the view as one in which intention plays a central role between the ”primary reason“ and the action. In the standard story, the agent’s ”desire for the end, and his belief in the action as a means … jointly cause an intention to take it, which in turn causes the corresponding movements of the agent’s body.“ . Davidson  himself came to accept that intentions play an important role in the causation and constitution of action and that intentions could not be reduced to beliefs or desires. But common to all these views is the idea that human actions are events that bear the right kind of causal relation to certain mental states or events of the agent that also explain the action.\n One alternative to the causal view understands agency as a form of irreducible agent-causation. Chisholm  presents a classic version of the view; Alvarez and Hyman  presents a radically different version which denies that agents cause the actions themselves; Mayr  develops a version of the view that, unlike Chisholm’s version, tries to show that human agency is not essentially different from other forms of substance causation that we find in the natural world. A second alternative sees intentional explanations as teleological rather than causal explanations ; that is, an intentional explanation cites the goal, the purpose, or the reason for which the agent acted rather than the antecedent causes of the action. Defenders of this view also try to provide an understanding of the teleological structure of intentional action that denies that teleological explanations reduce to causal explanations; they are instead a sui generis form of explanation. One way this view can meet Davidson’s Challenge is to argue that the truth of certain counterfactuals distinguishes potential reasons from the actual reasons. For instance, it could be true that even though the fact that the asparagus was delicious was a potential reason for Mary to eat asparagus, she would not have eaten them if they were not healthy and she would have eaten them even if they were not delicious ; such counterfactuals, on this view, are not grounded on causal relations between mental states and the bodily movements, but on the teleological structures that constitute intentional action. Finally, the causal account also contrasts with the neo-Aristotelian view in which human action is constituted, roughly, by a special form of practical knowledge ; on this view, in intentional action, ”knowledge is the  cause of what it understands“ (see section 4 of this entry).']";Well, that's a great point, and it gets to the heart of the concept of intentional action. Just because an action doesn't involve a lot of conscious thought, doesn't mean it's not intentional. Think of it like a skilled musician playing a piece they've practiced thousands of times. They don't consciously think about every note they're playing, but it's still an intentional action because it's guided by their prior intentions and habits. But, it does raise an important question about the causal relationship between mental states and actions. Do our mental states, like desires and intentions, actually cause our actions, or is there something more to it?;That makes sense, I guess. So, you're saying that intentions are like the spark that sets the whole thing in motion? But what about when I do something without really thinking about it?

Some philosophers, like Donald Davidson, argue that our mental states do cause our actions, while others, like Chisholm, argue that there's a more fundamental, irreducible aspect to agency that can't be reduced to simple causal relationships. And then there are those who argue that intentional explanations are more teleological, meaning they focus on the purpose or goal of the action, rather than just the antecedent causes. It's a complex issue, but one way to think about it is to consider counterfactuals. For example, imagine you're at a restaurant and you order asparagus. Did you order it because it was delicious, or because it's healthy? Perhaps it's a combination of both, but the counterfactuals – like what you would have done if it were only delicious, but not healthy – can help us understand the teleological structure of your intentional action.;I'm not sure.

"['\n Anscombe presents several arguments for the claim that to act intentionally an agent must know what she is doing (call this the ”knowledge condition’), and further arguments have been presented in the literature. This section surveys four influential arguments.\n One argument has already been mentioned: If a person is asked, “Why are you φ-ing?” and she (sincerely) replies, “I didn’t realize I was φ-ing” then she wasn’t φ-ing intentionally. It would seem to follow that a person must know what she is doing if acting intentionally. However, this argument is unsound. First, the expression “I didn’t realize…” is colloquially used to express complete lack of awareness, rather than mere ignorance .

However, there are also counterarguments and complexities to consider. But it's great that you're starting to see some of the connections between these ideas.;Yeah, I think I do.

"['\n The knowledge condition remains a controversial thesis in philosophy of action; but even those who reject it tend to hold that the connection between intentional action and knowledge is not accidental.

Not everyone agrees that knowledge is a necessary condition for intentional action, but it's certainly a popular view. To illustrate the issue, consider the following analogy: think of a jazz musician improvising on stage. The musician is acting intentionally when playing notes, but can they be said to 'know' exactly what notes they're playing in the sense that they have a conscious, explicit awareness? It's not clear. But perhaps we could say they know what they're doing in a more practical sense.;I've been thinking, Professor Phil, about how intentional actions and knowledge are connected.

"['\n The knowledge condition remains a controversial thesis in philosophy of action; but even those who reject it tend to hold that the connection between intentional action and knowledge is not accidental. Thus, there is a growing literature that aims to capture an important connection between knowledge and intentional action in weaker terms. These views can be categorized according to the term for which they recommend modification, whether (i) the practical state, (ii) the epistemic state, or (iii) the nature of the connection between them. (Naturally, since these are all compatible, some scholars recommend more than one revision.)\n Though regarded as Anscombe’s central opponent, Davidson himself recommended a version of (i). According to him, although agents need not know what they are doing under every description under which they act intentionally, they must know what they are doing under at least one description under which the action is intentional . The carbon copier, for instance, may not know that he is making 10 carbon copies, but he would have to know that he is making carbon copies, or that he is moving his hands, etc. Arguably, the idea that practical knowledge is restricted to knowledge of actions in progress is also a weakening of the thesis, since Anscombe appears to include also knowledge of future actions (§§51–2) and of completed actions such as the knowledge that I wrote my name on the board (§48) or even of what is written (§19). Indeed, it has been argued that imperfective and perfective knowledge are interdependent . Finally, other weakenings include the view that agents must know what they intend , what they are trying to do/that they are trying , or what basic actions they are performing . Since Anscombe’s thesis is strictly stronger than these, it follows that they will avoid certain problems that hers faces. However, it is not clear that such retreats help avoid the general problem, and restricting the thesis to more immediate occurrences—basic actions, intentions, or attempts—risks losing on the aforementioned feature that makes Anscombe’s view so interesting: the idea that we might bear the same intimate epistemic connection to something external as we bear to parts of our mental lives .\n Views that fall under (ii) have been influentially defended by several authors . A popular version of this view rejects a knowledge condition in favor of a belief condition : if the agent φs intentionally , she believes that she is φ-ing . Such a view is arguably better supported by some of Anscombe’s own arguments (such as the argument in terms of conversation dynamics above); and it seems to preserve a special place for actions as occurrences that are public but to which our minds bear a special epistemic relation. However, it has been argued that such views also suffer from problems, and fail to avoid counterexamples with the same structure as Davidson’s carbon copier, even though they are explanatorily weaker . Since authors like Setiya see the avoidance of counterexamples as a central payoff of the weakenings, it is unclear whether they are worth the costs in explanatory value.\n Finally, views that fall under (iii) aim to show that even if there isn’t a relation of entailment between action and practical knowledge, there might yet be an interesting connection between them. For instance, some authors have argued that agents normally or generally know what they are doing ; or that the kind of knowledge that agents have of their intentional action has special properties, such as being first-personal knowledge .']";Excellent!

"['\n A number of challenges have been raised in the literature to the claim that there must be a constitutive aim of action. First, suppose we accept the causal theory of action: an intentional action just is the effect of a “primary reason”. On such a view, it seems that an intentional action is constituted by its causal antecedents, rather than by a necessary aim that one has in acting. However, causal theories are not incompatible with constitutivism. Since on these views, some of the causal antecedents of the action will be conative states (like an intention), the question of whether intentional action has a constitutive aim will depend on whether the conative state has a constitutive aim or whether a specific conative state must always figure on the genesis of intentional action. For instance, in Velleman’s early work , intentional action was an action that was caused by a desire for self-knowledge, and the content of such a desire was thus the constitutive aim of agency. Smith  also develops a form of constitutivism that endorses the standard story of action.\n Setiya raises a couple of important challenges to the idea that action has a constitutive aim. According to Setiya , any theory of action needs to account for the fact that practical knowledge (or a belief condition in his version; see section 4 of this entry) is essential to intentional action. However, the belief condition seems to be conceptually independent of any constitutive aim of action, and thus accepting that both are constitutive of intentional action amounts to postulating an unexplained necessary connection.\n Secondly, Setiya  relies on the distinction between an explanatory reason and a normative reason to argue against the “guise of the good” ; his argument there could be extended to other proposals for the constitutive aim of action. An intentional action is an action done for an explanatory reason, namely, a reason that explains why the agent acted as she did, in Anscombe’s special sense of the question ‘Why’. However, Setiya points out that an explanatory reason need not be a normative reason; in fact, any reason that the agent believes to be her reason to act can be an explanatory reason, even if the object of such a reason is not good in any way. But since the reasons that explain intentional action need not be good in any way, it seems false that the agent must act only on reasons that she regards to be good in some way, and thus that she aims at the good in acting.\n Philosophers have tried to answer these challenges. One can argue that a knowledge or belief condition, to the extent that it is valid, is explained by the constitutive aim of action. Moreover, perhaps the possibility of a third-person explanation of an action in terms of explanatory reasons whose objects are not good in any way is compatible with the fact that from the first-person point of view, these objects must have been regarded to be good in some way. So even if the fact that Rugen kills his father explains why Inigo Montoya killed Rugen without providing a normative reason for it, it still might be the case that avenging his father must have appeared good to Inigo Montoya in some way if he killed Rugen intentionally .\n Another well-known challenge to the idea that actions have a constitutive aim is David Enoch’s “schmagency” objection ; in this context, the objection raises the possibility that for any purported constitutive aim, one could spurn such an aim and merely “schmact” or be a mere “schmagent”—someone who behaves just like an agent except for having the constitutive aim of agency.

"['\n The scope of our inactivity is vast; at each moment, there are many things I don’t do. Right now, I am not competing in the Olympics, not writing poetry, not swimming in the English Channel, not flying over the moon, or taking a journey to the center of the earth. However, none of the things could be plausibly described as cases of omissions or refrainings; it would be odd if I were told that I was refraining from competing in the Olympics or omitting to fly over the moon. Philosophers often describe cases of omissions as cases of my failing to do something that I was somehow “supposed to do” . Only some of my omissions are intentional or even voluntary: if my alarm does not go off and I miss my class because I overslept, I omitted to teach but not intentionally. On the other hand, if I fail to show up because I am protesting my university’s salary cuts, my omission was intentional.

However, the nuance lies in whether that choice is aligned with some expectation or obligation.

['Two doctrines dominate philosophical and psychological discussions of the relationship between action and space perception from the 18th to the early 20th century.

And later in the Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge :   …in strict truth the ideas of sight, when we apprehend by them distance and things placed at a distance, do not suggest or mark out to us things actually existing at a distance, but only admonish us what ideas of touch will be imprinted in our minds at such and such distances of time, and in consequence of such or such actions. …isible ideas are the language whereby the governing spirit … informs us what tangible ideas he is about to imprint upon us, in case we excite this or that motion in our own bodies. The view Berkeley defends in these passages has recognizable antecedents in Locke’s Essay Concerning Human Understanding . There Locke maintained that the immediate objects of sight are “flat” or lack outward depth; that sight must be coordinated with touch in order to mediate judgments concerning the disposition of objects in three-dimensional space; and that visible ideas “excite” in the mind movement-based ideas of distance through an associative process akin to that whereby words suggest their meanings: the process is   performed so constantly, and so quick, that we take that for the perception of our sensation, which is an idea formed by our judgment. \n A long line of philosophers—including Condillac , Reid , Smith , Mill , Bain , and Dewey —accepted this view of the relation between sight and touch.

The third respect in which action is central to the New Theory is psychological.

This echoes the classic philosophical conundrum of the 'neutral monism' presented by thinkers such as Hume – where the origins and mechanisms of sensation and perception are taken to resist any simple naturalistic explanation. However, let us flip this question around: Are we assuming that certainty about our perceptions is necessarily tied to its immediacy, or its correspondence to some sort of objective reality? What if, as some have argued, we needn't overly distinguish between the ' true sensory data' and our understanding of that data? Perhaps our action-based capacity to navigate the world justifies the viability of our perception, in lieu of purely 'sensory accuracy.';But is this process not vulnerable to error?

There Locke maintained that the immediate objects of sight are “flat” or lack outward depth; that sight must be coordinated with touch in order to mediate judgments concerning the disposition of objects in three-dimensional space; and that visible ideas “excite” in the mind movement-based ideas of distance through an associative process akin to that whereby words suggest their meanings: the process is   performed so constantly, and so quick, that we take that for the perception of our sensation, which is an idea formed by our judgment. \n A long line of philosophers—including Condillac , Reid , Smith , Mill , Bain , and Dewey —accepted this view of the relation between sight and touch.

Although Berkeley does not explain how vision instructs us in regulating our actions, the answer is reasonably clear from the preceding account of depth perception: seeing an object or scene can elicit tangible ideas that directly motivate self-preserving action. The tactual ideas associated with a rapidly looming ball in the visual field, for example, can directly motivate the subject to shift position defensively or to catch it before being struck.  The third respect in which action is central to the New Theory is psychological. Tangible ideas of distance are elicited not only by (1) visual or “pictorial” depth cues such as object’s degree of blurriness (objects appear increasingly “confused” as they approach the observer), but also by kinaesthetic, muscular sensations resulting from (2) changes in the vergence angle of the eyes  and (3) accommodation of the lens .

This introduces another crucial perspective, often called 'enkinaesthetic.' By realizing that our perception incorporates actually local movement or the possibility of movement – through our head's sensorimotor kinaesthesia – one can be led to£o converging upon more relational conceptions of depth itself. Here's a simple visual analogy: take a looking glass – static – mirror in your hand. Earth remains still under your reflection when not doing anything – but push your body forward – Thus breaking mirror-relations for depths-concept from otherwise relegated- connotations based-in-to flat paper plane concepts itself without a denomination frozen merely insist assertion on.;Navigation implies movement and change in environment.

Our understanding of depth perception does indeed rely on a complex interplay between immediate sensual experiences – namely, sight and touch – to create a coherent picture of our surroundings. Think of it like interpreting a novel: the words on the page, in and of themselves, are flat and two-dimensional, but our mind weaves a rich narrative, imbuing them with meaning and context, to create an immersive experience. In much the same way, our brain is actively interpreting visual cues and supplementing them with tactile associations, creating an expansive understanding of the world.;But is this process not vulnerable to error?

This echoes the classic philosophical conundrum of the 'neutral monism' presented by thinkers such as Hume – where the origins and mechanisms of sensation and perception are taken to resist any simple naturalistic explanation. However, let us flip this question around: Are we assuming that certainty about our perceptions is necessarily tied to its immediacy, or its correspondence to some sort of objective reality? What if, as some have argued, we needn't overly distinguish between the 'true sensory data' and our understanding of that data? Perhaps our action-based capacity to navigate the world justifies the viability of our perception, in lieu of purely 'sensory accuracy.';Navigation implies movement and change in environment. In many ways, these changes contribute to the unfolding depth in our perception.

"['   …I say, neither distance, nor things placed at a distance are themselves, or their ideas, truly perceived by sight…. whoever will look narrowly into his own thoughts, and examine what he means by saying, he sees this or that thing at a distance, will agree with me, that what he sees only suggests to his understanding, that after having passed a certain distance, to be measured by the motion of his body, which is perceivable by touch, he shall come to perceive such and such tangible ideas which have been usually connected with such and such visible ideas.  And later in the Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge :   …in strict truth the ideas of sight, when we apprehend by them distance and things placed at a distance, do not suggest or mark out to us things actually existing at a distance, but only admonish us what ideas of touch will be imprinted in our minds at such and such distances of time, and in consequence of such or such actions. …isible ideas are the language whereby the governing spirit … informs us what tangible ideas he is about to imprint upon us, in case we excite this or that motion in our own bodies. The view Berkeley defends in these passages has recognizable antecedents in Locke’s Essay Concerning Human Understanding . There Locke maintained that the immediate objects of sight are “flat” or lack outward depth; that sight must be coordinated with touch in order to mediate judgments concerning the disposition of objects in three-dimensional space; and that visible ideas “excite” in the mind movement-based ideas of distance through an associative process akin to that whereby words suggest their meanings: the process is   performed so constantly, and so quick, that we take that for the perception of our sensation, which is an idea formed by our judgment. \n A long line of philosophers—including Condillac , Reid , Smith , Mill , Bain , and Dewey —accepted this view of the relation between sight and touch. The second respect in which action plays a prominent role in the New Theory is teleological. Sight not only derives its three-dimensional spatial significance from bodily movement, its purpose is to help us engage in such movement adaptively:   …the proper objects of vision constitute an universal language of the Author of nature, whereby we are instructed how to regulate our actions, in order to attain those things, that are necessary to the preservation and well-being of our bodies, as also to avoid whatever may be hurtful and destructive of them. It is by their information that we are principally guided in all the transactions and concerns of life.  Although Berkeley does not explain how vision instructs us in regulating our actions, the answer is reasonably clear from the preceding account of depth perception: seeing an object or scene can elicit tangible ideas that directly motivate self-preserving action. The tactual ideas associated with a rapidly looming ball in the visual field, for example, can directly motivate the subject to shift position defensively or to catch it before being struck.  The third respect in which action is central to the New Theory is psychological. Tangible ideas of distance are elicited not only by (1) visual or “pictorial” depth cues such as object’s degree of blurriness (objects appear increasingly “confused” as they approach the observer), but also by kinaesthetic, muscular sensations resulting from (2) changes in the vergence angle of the eyes  and (3) accommodation of the lens . Like many contemporary theories of spatial vision, the Berkeleyan account thus acknowledges an important role for oculomotor factors in our perception of distance.']";A spot on observation. This introduces another crucial perspective, often called 'enkinaesthetic.' By realizing that our perception incorporates actual local movement or the possibility of movement – through our head's sensorimotor kinaesthesia – one can be led to converging upon more relational conceptions of depth itself. Here's a simple visual analogy: take a looking glass – static – mirror in your hand. Earth remains still under your reflection when not doing anything – but push your body forward – Thus breaking mirror-relations for depths-concept from otherwise relegated connotations based-in-to flat paper plane concepts itself without a denomination frozen merely insisting on assertion objectivity.;How do philosophers make use of the insight that vision is inseparable from action?;['distance', 'thing', 'place', 'distance', 'idea', 'truly', 'perceive', 'sight', 'look', 'narrowly', 'thought', 'examine', 'mean', 'say', 'see', 'thing', 'distance', 'agree', 'see', 'suggest', 'understanding', 'having', 'pass', 'certain', 'distance', 'measure', 'motion', 'body', 'perceivable', 'touch', 'shall', 'come', 'perceive', 'tangible', 'idea', 'usually', 'connect', 'visible', 'idea', 'later', 'treatise', 'concern', 'principles', 'human', 'knowledge', 'strict', 'truth', 'idea', 'sight', 'apprehend', 'distance', 'thing', 'place', 'distance', 'suggest', 'mark', 'thing', 'actually', 'exist', 'distance', 'admonish', 'idea', 'touch', 'imprint', 'mind', 'distance', 'time', 'consequence', 'action', 'isible', 'idea', 'language', 'govern', 'spirit', 'inform', 'tangible', 'idea', 'imprint', 'case', 'excite', 'motion', 'body', 'view', 'berkeley', 'defend', 'passage', 'recognizable', 'antecedent', 'locke', 'essay', 'concern', 'human', 'understanding', 'locke', 'maintain', 'immediate', 'object', 'sight', 'flat', 'lack', 'outward', 'depth', 'sight', 'coordinate', 'touch', 'order', 'mediate', 'judgment', 'concern', 'disposition', 'object', 'dimensional', 'space', 'visible', 'idea', 'excite', 'mind', 'movement', 'base', 'idea', 'distance', 'associative', 'process', 'akin', 'word', 'suggest', 'meaning', 'process', 'perform', 'constantly', 'quick', 'perception', 'sensation', 'idea', 'form', 'judgment', 'long', 'line', 'philosopher', 'include', 'condillac', 'reid', 'smith', 'mill', 'bain', 'dewey', 'accept', 'view', 'relation', 'sight', 'touch', 'second', 'respect', 'action', 'play', 'prominent', 'role', 'new', 'theory', 'teleological', 'sight', 'derive', 'dimensional', 'spatial', 'significance', 'bodily', 'movement', 'purpose', 'help', 'engage', 'movement', 'adaptively', 'proper', 'object', 'vision', 'constitute', 'universal', 'language', 'author', 'nature', 'instruct', 'regulate', 'action', 'order', 'attain', 'thing', 'necessary', 'preservation', 'body', 'avoid', 'hurtful', 'destructive', 'information', 'principally', 'guide', 'transaction', 'concern', 'life', 'berkeley', 'explain', 'vision', 'instruct', 'regulate', 'action', 'answer', 'reasonably', 'clear', 'precede', 'account', 'depth', 'perception', 'see', 'object', 'scene', 'elicit', 'tangible', 'idea', 'directly', 'motivate', 'self', 'preserve', 'action', 'tactual', 'idea', 'associate', 'rapidly', 'loom', 'ball', 'visual', 'field', 'example', 'directly', 'motivate', 'subject', 'shift', 'position', 'defensively', 'catch', 'strike', 'respect', 'action', 'central', 'new', 'theory', 'psychological', 'tangible', 'idea', 'distance', 'elicit', 'visual', 'pictorial', 'depth', 'cue', 'object', 'degree', 'blurriness', 'object', 'appear', 'increasingly', 'confused', 'approach', 'observer', 'kinaesthetic', 'muscular', 'sensation', 'result', 'change', 'vergence', 'angle', 'eye', 'accommodation', 'lens', 'like', 'contemporary', 'theory', 'spatial', 'vision', 'berkeleyan', 'account', 'acknowledge', 'important', 'role', 'oculomotor', 'factor', 'perception', 'distance'];['spot', 'observation', 'introduce', 'crucial', 'perspective', 'call', 'enkinaesthetic', 'realize', 'perception', 'incorporate', 'actual', 'local', 'movement', 'possibility', 'movement', 'head', 'sensorimotor', 'kinaesthesia', 'lead', 'converge', 'relational', 'conception', 'depth', 'simple', 'visual', 'analogy', 'look', 'glass', 'static', 'mirror', 'hand', 'earth', 'remain', 'reflection', 'push', 'body', 'forward', 'break', 'mirror', 'relation', 'depth', 'concept', 'relegate', 'connotation', 'base', 'flat', 'paper', 'plane', 'concept', 'denomination', 'freeze', 'merely', 'insist', 'assertion', 'objectivity'];['philosopher', 'use', 'insight', 'vision', 'inseparable', 'action']
