"['You happen to know that Tim and Harry have recently had a terrible row that ended their friendship. Now someone tells you that she just saw Tim and Harry jogging together. The best explanation for this that you can think of is that they made up. You conclude that they are friends again.\n One morning you enter the kitchen to find a plate and cup on the table, with breadcrumbs and a pat of butter on it, and surrounded by a jar of jam, a pack of sugar, and an empty carton of milk. You conclude that one of your house-mates got up at night to make him- or herself a midnight snack and was too tired to clear the table. This, you think, best explains the scene you are facing. To be sure, it might be that someone burgled the house and took the time to have a bite while on the job, or a house-mate might have arranged the things on the table without having a midnight snack but just to make you believe that someone had a midnight snack. But these hypotheses strike you as providing much more contrived explanations of the data than the one you infer to.\n Walking along the beach, you see what looks like a picture of Winston Churchill in the sand. It could be that, as in the opening pages of Hilary Putnam’s book Reason, Truth, and History, , what you see is actually the trace of an ant crawling on the beach. The much simpler, and therefore (you think) much better, explanation is that someone intentionally drew a picture of Churchill in the sand. That, in any case, is what you come away believing.\n In these examples, the conclusions do not follow logically from the premises. For instance, it does not follow logically that Tim and Harry are friends again from the premises that they had a terrible row which ended their friendship and that they have just been seen jogging together; it does not even follow, we may suppose, from all the information you have about Tim and Harry. Nor do you have any useful statistical data about friendships, terrible rows, and joggers that might warrant an inference from the information that you have about Tim and Harry to the conclusion that they are friends again, or even to the conclusion that, probably (or with a certain probability), they are friends again. What leads you to the conclusion, and what according to a considerable number of philosophers may also warrant this conclusion, is precisely the fact that Tim and Harry’s being friends again would, if true, best explain the fact that they have just been seen jogging together. (The proviso that a hypothesis be true if it is to explain anything is taken as read from here on.) Similar remarks apply to the other two examples. The type of inference exhibited here is called abduction or, somewhat more commonly nowadays, Inference to the Best Explanation.']";"That's a great question! You see, our brains are wired to look for the most plausible explanation for a given set of circumstances. In this case, the presence of dirty dishes and a cereal box suggests that someone had a meal, but the question is, who? You infer that it was your roommate because that's the most straightforward and logical explanation, given the context. It's like a puzzle: you're trying to find the piece that fits best, and in this case, the ""roommate had breakfast"" piece fits better than the ""burglar had a snack"" piece.";Professor, I was thinking about how I concluded that my roommate made breakfast yesterday just by seeing the dirty dishes and cereal box in the sink. It seemed like a pretty reasonable thing to assume, but I realized I wasn't 100% sure it was actually them. How did I really know it was my roommate and not, say, a burglar who decided to have a snack?

But here's the thing: our reasoning is based on probabilities, not certainties. We weigh the likelihood of one explanation against another, and we choose the one that seems most probable. In this case, the likelihood of your roommate eating breakfast is higher than the likelihood of a burglar breaking in just to have a snack. It's not a guarantee, but it's a reasonable inference based on the evidence you have.;But isn't that just an assumption? I mean, I could be wrong about my roommate eating breakfast. What if I am?

Abduction is the process of inferring the most likely explanation for a given set of circumstances, even if it's not a logically guaranteed conclusion. In the case of the Churchill picture, you infer that someone drew it because that's the most plausible explanation, given the complexity and coherence of the image. It's unlikely that the wind and sand would randomly create a perfect picture of Churchill, so you abductively infer that someone intentionally drew it. Does that make sense?;That makes sense, I guess. But what about cases where the explanation isn't so clear-cut? Like, I saw a picture of Winston Churchill drawn in the sand on the beach the other day. How do I know someone actually drew it, and it's not just a random pattern that looks like Churchill?

Our minds are wired to seek patterns and explanations, and we use abduction to make sense of the world. It's not always a logically airtight process, but it's a fundamental aspect of how we reason and understand the world around us.;Yeah, I think so. It's like, our brains are always trying to find a story that explains what we see, and we choose the story that's most likely to be true.
"['\n Even if it is true that we routinely rely on abductive reasoning, it may still be asked whether this practice is rational. For instance, experimental studies have shown that when people are able to think of an explanation for some possible event, they tend to overestimate the likelihood that this event will actually occur.  More telling still, Lombrozo  shows that, in some situations, people tend to grossly overrate the probability of simpler explanations compared to more complicated ones. Although these studies are not directly concerned with abduction in any of the forms discussed so far, they nevertheless suggest that taking into account explanatory considerations in one’s reasoning may not always be for the better. (It is to be noted that Lombrozo’s experiments are directly concerned with some proposals that have been made for explicating abduction in a Bayesian framework; see Section 4.) However, the most pertinent remarks about the normative status of abduction are so far to be found in the philosophical literature. This section discusses the main criticisms that have been levelled against abduction, as well as the strongest arguments that have been given in its defense.']";"Well, my inquisitive student, that's a great question. You see, our minds are wired to seek simplicity, often relying on what's called ""abductive reasoning."" It's like a game of Occam's Razor: we tend to favor the explanation that requires the fewest assumptions. Think of it like a mathematical equation – the simpler the solution, the more elegant. But, does that mean it's always the best approach? Not necessarily. Consider this analogy: a master chef might use a few complex ingredients to create a harmonious dish, while a novice might oversimplify and end up with a bland meal. Sometimes, simplicity can lead to oversimplification.";Professor Phil, do we always choose the simplest explanation for a phenomenon, and is that always the best approach?

Yes, when dealing with incomplete data, we often resort to what's known as ""inference to the best explanation"" (IBE). It's like trying to solve a puzzle with missing pieces – we fill in the gaps with the most plausible explanation, even if it's not the simplest. However, this is where things can get tricky. Research has shown that people tend to overestimate the likelihood of events based on how easily they can explain them. It's like our minds are biased toward confirming our own narratives. This raises questions about the rationality of relying on abductive reasoning, especially when it comes to estimating probabilities.";That's a great point, Professor. But what about when we're faced with limited information? Don't we tend to rely on the most plausible explanation, even if it's not the simplest?

Yes, simplicity can sometimes lead to a lack of critical thinking. When we settle for a simple explanation, we might overlook more nuanced or complex factors at play. This is where a more Bayesian approach can come in handy – considering the probability of competing explanations and updating our beliefs accordingly. It's like refining our recipe, if you will, to account for the complexity of the situation. Your colleague's concern highlights the importance of balancing simplicity with a critical evaluation of alternative explanations.;"That reminds me of a conversation I had with a colleague about the importance of considering alternative explanations. They argued that simplicity can sometimes lead to a kind of ""explanatory laziness."" Do you think that's a valid concern?"

The critics of abduction, like some of the authors mentioned in this text, argue that our reliance on explanatory considerations can lead to errors and biases. However, proponents of abduction would counter that it's still a valuable tool, as long as we're aware of its limitations. It's like using a hammer – it's a great tool for driving nails, but not so much for screwing in light bulbs. We need to be aware of when and how to apply abductive reasoning, and to continually update our understanding based on new evidence. By acknowledging its limitations and being mindful of our own biases, I think we can defend abduction as a rational approach, albeit a nuanced one.;I see what you mean, Professor. It's like we need to strike a balance between simplicity and nuance. But what about the critics of abduction who argue that it's not always a rational approach? How do we respond to those concerns?
['\n The Buddha’s discourses collected in the Āgamas/Nikāyas analyze sentient experience from different standpoints: in terms of name-and-form (nāma-rūpa), the five aggregates (Skt., skandha, Pali, khandha), the twelve sense fields (āyatana), or the eighteen sense elements (dhātu). All these modes of analysis provide descriptions of sentient experience as a succession of physical and mental processes that arise and cease subject to various causes and conditions. A striking difference between the Sūtrānta and the Abhidharma worldviews is that the Abhidharma reduces the time scale of these processes so they are now seen as operating from moment to moment. Put differently, the Abhidharma reinterprets the terms by which the sūtras portray sequential processes as applying to discrete, momentary events .\n These events are referred to as dharmas (Pali, dhammas), differently from the singular dharma/dhamma that signifies the Buddha’s teaching(s). The Āgamas/Nikāyas use the form dharmas to convey a pluralistic representation of encountered phenomena, i.e., all sensory phenomena of whatever nature as we experience them through the six sense faculties (the five ordinary physical senses plus mind ). The canonical Abhidharma treatises, however, draw subtle distinctions within the scope of the mental and marginalize the differences between multiple varieties of mental capacities. Within this context, dharmas are seen as the objects of a specific mental capacity called mental cognitive awareness (Skt., manovijñāṇa, Pali, manoviññāṇa) that is considered the central cognitive operation in the process of sensory perception. Mental cognitive awareness is a particular type of consciousness that discerns between the stimuli impinging upon the sense faculties and that emerges when the requisite conditions come together. Dharmas are not merely mental objects like ideas, concepts, or memories. Rather, as the objects of mental cognitive awareness, dharmas may be rendered apperceptions: rapid consciousness-types (citta) that arise and cease in sequential streams, each having its own object, and that interact with the five externally directed sensory modalities (visual, auditory, etc.) of cognitive awareness. The canonical Abhidharma texts portray dharmas, then, as psycho-physical events with diverse capacities by means of which the mind unites and assimilates a particular perception, especially one newly presented, to a larger set or mass of ideas already possessed, thus comprehending and conceptualizing  it.\n Ultimately, dharmas are all that there is: all experiential events are understood as arising from the interaction of dharmas. While the analogy of atoms may be useful here, dharmas notably embrace both physical and mental phenomena, and are generally understood as evanescent events, occurrences, or dynamic properties rather than enduring  substances.  The Abhidharma exegesis thus attempts to provide an exhaustive account of every possible type of experience—every type of occurrence that may possibly present itself in one’s consciousness—in terms of its constituent dharmas. This enterprise involves breaking down the objects of ordinary perception into their constituent, discrete dharmas and clarifying their relations of causal conditioning. The overarching inquiry subsuming both the analysis of dharmas into multiple categories and their synthesis into a unified structure by means of their manifold relationships of causal conditioning is referred to as the “dharma theory.”'];Ah, you're onto something. Think of a movie. A movie appears to be a continuous flow of images, but in reality, it's just a series of individual frames, each one static, that create the illusion of movement when played in rapid succession. Similarly, Buddhist thinkers like the Abhidharma suggest that our experience of reality is composed of discrete, momentary events or 'dharmas.' These dharmas are the building blocks of our perception, and they arise and cease rapidly, giving us the impression of a continuous reality.;Professor Phil, I was reading this book about Buddhism and it said that reality is made up of tiny, fleeting moments. Is that even possible?

The Abhidharma philosophers would say that indeed, everything is impermanent, and our perceptions are based on these constantly changing dharmas. However, they wouldn't say that our perceptions are therefore unreliable. Rather, they'd argue that our understanding of reality is based on the relationships between these dharmas, and how they condition and interact with each other. It's like trying to understand a river – the water molecules themselves are constantly changing, but the river's flow and patterns can still be understood and predicted by examining their relationships and interactions.;But if everything is made up of these fleeting moments, doesn't that mean that nothing is permanent or stable? How can we trust our perceptions of the world if everything is always changing?

This, in turn, can help us develop a greater sense of clarity and insight into the nature of reality, which is ultimately liberating. It's like taking apart a machine to see how its components work together – once we understand the individual parts and their relationships, we can begin to see the bigger picture and how it all fits together.;I think I see. So it's like the river is made up of individual droplets of water, but we can still talk about the river as a whole and understand its behavior.

Think of it like a conversation – the words I speak (physical phenomenon) and the meaning you understand (mental phenomenon) are not separate things, but are intimately connected and arise together as a single event. By analyzing reality into its constituent dharmas, we can begin to see how our experiences – both physical and mental – are intertwined and interdependent.;That makes sense, I think. But what about the idea that these dharmas are not just physical events, but also mental ones? How does that work?
['\n The Buddha’s discourses collected in the Āgamas/Nikāyas analyze sentient experience from different standpoints: in terms of name-and-form (nāma-rūpa), the five aggregates (Skt., skandha, Pali, khandha), the twelve sense fields (āyatana), or the eighteen sense elements (dhātu). All these modes of analysis provide descriptions of sentient experience as a succession of physical and mental processes that arise and cease subject to various causes and conditions. A striking difference between the Sūtrānta and the Abhidharma worldviews is that the Abhidharma reduces the time scale of these processes so they are now seen as operating from moment to moment. Put differently, the Abhidharma reinterprets the terms by which the sūtras portray sequential processes as applying to discrete, momentary events .\n These events are referred to as dharmas (Pali, dhammas), differently from the singular dharma/dhamma that signifies the Buddha’s teaching(s). The Āgamas/Nikāyas use the form dharmas to convey a pluralistic representation of encountered phenomena, i.e., all sensory phenomena of whatever nature as we experience them through the six sense faculties (the five ordinary physical senses plus mind ). The canonical Abhidharma treatises, however, draw subtle distinctions within the scope of the mental and marginalize the differences between multiple varieties of mental capacities. Within this context, dharmas are seen as the objects of a specific mental capacity called mental cognitive awareness (Skt., manovijñāṇa, Pali, manoviññāṇa) that is considered the central cognitive operation in the process of sensory perception. Mental cognitive awareness is a particular type of consciousness that discerns between the stimuli impinging upon the sense faculties and that emerges when the requisite conditions come together. Dharmas are not merely mental objects like ideas, concepts, or memories. Rather, as the objects of mental cognitive awareness, dharmas may be rendered apperceptions: rapid consciousness-types (citta) that arise and cease in sequential streams, each having its own object, and that interact with the five externally directed sensory modalities (visual, auditory, etc.) of cognitive awareness. The canonical Abhidharma texts portray dharmas, then, as psycho-physical events with diverse capacities by means of which the mind unites and assimilates a particular perception, especially one newly presented, to a larger set or mass of ideas already possessed, thus comprehending and conceptualizing  it.\n Ultimately, dharmas are all that there is: all experiential events are understood as arising from the interaction of dharmas. While the analogy of atoms may be useful here, dharmas notably embrace both physical and mental phenomena, and are generally understood as evanescent events, occurrences, or dynamic properties rather than enduring  substances.  The Abhidharma exegesis thus attempts to provide an exhaustive account of every possible type of experience—every type of occurrence that may possibly present itself in one’s consciousness—in terms of its constituent dharmas. This enterprise involves breaking down the objects of ordinary perception into their constituent, discrete dharmas and clarifying their relations of causal conditioning. The overarching inquiry subsuming both the analysis of dharmas into multiple categories and their synthesis into a unified structure by means of their manifold relationships of causal conditioning is referred to as the “dharma theory.”'];The Abhidharma would say that the ultimate goal is not just understanding, but liberation. By gaining a deep understanding of how our experiences arise and how they're interconnected, we can begin to see through our habitual ways of perceiving and thinking, and develop a greater sense of freedom and clarity in our lives. It's like seeing through the illusion of the movie – once we understand the individual frames that make it up, we can begin to see the world in a new and more profound way.;Okay, I think I'm starting to get it. But what's the ultimate goal of all this analysis? Is it just to understand how the world works, or is there something more to it?
['What is an ability? On one reading, this question is a demand for a theory of ability of the sort described above. On another reading, however, this question simply asks for a rough guide to what sort of things we are speaking of when we speak of ‘abilities’. So understood, this question is not asking for a theory of ability, but for an explanation of what exactly a theory of ability would be a theory of. This section will offer an answer to this question on this second, more modest, reading.'];That's a great question. Think of it like this: when we say someone has the ability to play the guitar, we're not just talking about the physical actions involved, like pressing strings or strumming. We're also talking about the underlying capacity to understand music, to learn, and to create music on the guitar. It's like a bundle of skills and knowledge that allow someone to do something. But, what exactly is that bundle? Is it just a collection of things we can do, or is it something more?;Professor Phil, I've been wondering, how do we define something as an ability? I mean, what makes something we can do an ability?

Some philosophers argue that abilities are only things we can physically do, like playing the guitar or riding a bike. But others say that abilities include more abstract things like problem-solving, reasoning, or even virtues like compassion or courage. The question is, where do we draw the line? And what do we mean by 'ability' when we're talking about such different things? Are we talking about the same thing, or are we using the word 'ability' to describe different concepts?;Hmm, I never thought about it that way. But doesn't it get fuzzy when we start talking about things like intelligence or creativity? Are those abilities too?

Trying to pin down an exact definition of ability can be like trying to grasp a handful of sand – the harder you squeeze, the more it slips away. But if we can get a rough sense of what we mean by 'ability', we might be able to understand the different ways the term is used, and how it relates to other concepts like capacity, skill, and talent. And who knows, we might even discover that our intuitive understanding of ability is more nuanced than we thought.;That makes sense. So, are we trying to come up with a precise definition of ability, or just a rough idea of what we mean?
['\n It will be helpful to begin by considering a topic that is related to, but nominally distinct from, abilities: dispositions.\n Dispositions are, at first pass, those properties picked out by predicates like ‘is fragile’ or ‘is soluble’, or alternatively by sentences of the form ‘x is disposed to break when struck’ or ‘x is disposed to dissolve when placed in water.’\xa0Dispositions so understood have figured centrally in the metaphysics and philosophy of science of the last century , and also in influential accounts of the mind . They are like abilities in many significant respects, in particular in the fact that they are properties of things that can exist even when not manifested: as a glass may be fragile even when it is not broken, so may a person have the ability to raise her arm even when she is not raising her arm.\n While dispositions have been central to contemporary philosophical discussions, they do not exhaust the range of the possibilities inherent in things. Especially notable, for present purposes, are those that are intimately connected to agency. These include the susceptibility of things to be acted on in certain ways — such as the edibility of an apple, or the walkability of a trail — that the psychologist J.J. Gibson called affordances . These include also the powers of action that we ascribe to things, of the kind observed by Thomas Reid: ‘Thus we say, the wind blows, the sea rages, the sun rises and sets, bodies gravitate and move’ . Finally, and crucially, these include the powers of agents themselves.\n In light of this ontological diversity, it will be useful to have a term that encompasses all the possibilities inherent in things and in agents.

But our initial hypothesis is that dispositions are simply one member of the broader family of powers, albeit one that has received a great measure of attention in the philosophical literature.'];That's an intriguing question. To explore this idea, let's consider the following analogy: imagine a key and a lock. We would typically say that the key has the ability to unlock the door, but does it make sense to say that the key has an ability independent of the lock's existence? In a sense, the ability is relational, it requires both the key and the lock to function.;Professor, I've been thinking about abilities and how they relate to the natural world. Can we apply the concept of abilities to inanimate objects?

I'd argue that in cases like the river, we're seeing a manifestation of what philosopher J.J. Gibson called affordances – the river's flow and the stone's properties create an opportunity for erosion. But, we could also view it as an expression of the river's power or disposition to shape its environment.;That makes sense, but what about natural phenomena like a river's ability to carve through stone? Is that a true ability, or is it just a result of the environment?

While related, dispositions and powers are distinct. A disposition is more of an intrinsic property of an object, whereas a power or ability is often relational and involves an interaction with the environment. To illustrate, consider a light bulb: it has the disposition to produce light when a certain voltage is applied, but its power or ability to illuminate a room depends on many factors, like the presence of a power source and the environment.;I'm starting to see how these concepts are interconnected. But how do you distinguish between a disposition, like a glass being fragile, and a power or ability? Are they just different layers of description?

Some argue that dispositions are fundamental and that all powers can be reduced to them. Others, like philosopher Thomas Reid, suggest that powers, including those of agents, are distinct and irreducible. As I see it, dispositions are a member of the broader family of powers, but whether they're privileged or fundamental remains an open question.;That helps clarify the distinction. However, I'm still unsure about the relationship between dispositions and powers. Do dispositions underlie all powers, or are they separate entities?

Recognizing the ontological diversity of powers forces us to reexamine our understanding of agency, free will, and moral responsibility. It's a fascinating area of inquiry, and one that warrants further exploration in the realm of practical philosophy.;That makes sense. It seems to me that this has significant implications for how we think about agency and morality. By acknowledging the diversity of powers within the natural world, we may need to reassess our assumptions about human agency.
['\n Abilities, then, are a kind of power. What kind of power, precisely, is an ability? As the term will be understood here, there are two additional conditions that a power must meet in order for it to be an ability. First, abilities are distinguished by their subjects. Abilities are properties of agents, rather than of things that are not agents. Objects have dispositions and affordances — as a glass is disposed to break when struck, or affords the drinking of liquid — but they do not have abilities. Being a power of an agent is not, however, a sufficient condition for being an ability. This is because agents have powers that are not abilities. Therefore, second, abilities need to be distinguished by their objects: abilities relate agents to actions.\n Some examples may make the need for this second condition clear. Some powers, though properties of agents, do not intuitively involve any relation to action. Consider the power of understanding language. Understanding a sentence, while it is not wholly passive or arational, is not typically an action. In contrast, speaking a sentence is. Thus the power to understand French will not be an ability, on the present taxonomy. In contrast the power to speak French will be an ability, since it involves a relation to action. \n So, as the term will be understood here, an ability is a power that relates an agent to an action. This way of demarcating abilities, while serviceable for our purposes, is not unproblematic. For it inherits the problems involved in drawing the distinction between actions and non-actions. First, there is the problem that the domain of action is itself a contentious matter. Second, there is the problem that, even if we have settled on an account of action, it is plausible that the domain of action will be vague, so that there are some events that are not definitely actions, but that are not definitely not actions either. Arguably both of these points about action apply, also, to the property of being an agent. If this is right, then the present account of ability, which is cashed out in terms of agency and action, will be correspondingly contentious and vague. Borderline cases may, in the end, generate problems for the theory of ability. But such problems will not be central here. For giving such a theory will be difficult enough even when we focus on paradigm cases of agency and action, and so on paradigm cases of ability.\n Note there is a similarity between the present category of ability, as distinct from other powers, and the traditional category of active powers, where active powers are those that essentially involve the will . But it is not clear that these distinctions overlap exactly. For example, the power to will itself will clearly be an active power. It is less clear whether it will count as an ability, for the answer to that question will turn on the contentious question of whether willing is itself an action.'];That's an excellent question. Think of it like this: the difference is similar to having a piano versus actually playing it. Just as having the piano provides the possibility, but not the guarantee, of beautiful music, having the ability to do something similarly doesn't ensure that you'll actually do it. Now, consider this: can inanimate objects have abilities?;Professor Phil, I was wondering - are there any differences between being able to do something and actually doing it?

A piano may be capable of producing music, but it's not an ability in the same sense that a person playing it has. A piano's capability is a disposition, not an ability. And that distinction brings us to another point: not all powers exhibited by agents qualify as abilities either. What do you think about the power of understanding language? Should that be considered an ability?;Hmm, I guess not? Like a piano can't play itself.

Understanding language involves a certain passivity, a receptivity to meaning, whereas using language - like speaking - is more of an action. This takes us back to the distinction between merely having a power and having an ability that relates the agent to a specific action. So in this case, the power to understand French wouldn't be an ability, whereas the power to speak French would. But here's a tricky one: does this imply that the line between actions and non-actions is always clear-cut?;That's a tough one... I don't know, perhaps not?

Think of cases like dreaming or sleepwalking. Are those actions, and if so, to what extent? The difficulty in distinguishing actions from non-actions seeps into our understanding of abilities as well. It's an issue with the theory, but for the purposes of our discussion, let's focus on the clearer cases where actions and abilities are more intuitively defined.;Actually, I'm not sure... Can't there be cases where it's difficult to tell whether something is an action or not?
['\n Some will expect that an account of ability would also be an account of what it is to know how to perform an action, on the supposition that one knows how to perform a certain action just in case one has the ability to perform that action. This supposition, which we may call the Rylean account of know how , has been called into question by Jason Stanley and Timothy Williamson . Let us briefly consider Stanley and Williamson’s argument and how it bears on the theory of ability.\n Stanley and Williamson argue, on broadly linguistic grounds, that our default view of know how ought to be rather different from Ryle’s. Part of the argument for this is that standard treatments of embedded questions  suggest a rather different treatment. On this treatment, to know how to A is to know a certain proposition. At first pass, in Stanley and Williamson’s presentation, for S to know how to A is for S to know, of some contextually relevant way of acting w, that w is a way for S to A. Stanley and Williamson develop and defend such a treatment, and offer independent considerations for rejecting Ryle’s own arguments for the Rylean view. On their view, then, to know how to A is not to have an ability.\n Stanley and Williamson’s arguments are far from widely accepted , but they tell at the very least against simply assuming that an account of ability will also be an account of know how. So we will leave questions of know how to one side in what follows. It is also reasonable to hope that an account of ability, while it may not simply be an account of know how, will at least shed light on disputes about know how. For so long as we lack a theory of what an ability is, the precise content of the Rylean view (and of its denial) remains unclear. So it may be that getting clear on abilities may help us, perhaps indirectly, to get clear on know how as well. , as well as the papers collected in .\n Whatever our view of ability and know how, there is a further question at the intersection of these topics that bears consideration. This is how to accommodate those powers of agents that appear to be especially closely connected to practical intelligence, such as skills and talents — which we might collectively call the intelligent powers. Are the intelligent powers simply a species of ability, or do they demand an independent treatment? There are a number of recent proposals to be considered here. (Robb forthcoming) proposes a dispositionalist theory of talent, on which a talent is a disposition to maintain and develop a skill.  emphasizes the significance of a distinctive kind of intelligent power, which she (following Ryle) calls an ‘intelligent capacity,’ and of which she too offers a broadly dispositionalist account. These proposals suggest a more general program of dispositionalism about the intelligent powers, which has suggestive parallels to the dispositionalism about ability that we will consider in Section 5.1. Still more generally, accurately accounting for the nature of the intelligent powers, and the relationship of these to abilities and to the powers more generally, remains an open and intriguing problem. 1.3 ‘Know how’ and the intelligent powers\n If one wants to give a theory of ability of the sort described at the outset, it is helpful for that theory to observe some formal distinctions that have been marked in the literature. This section canvasses two of the most important formal\xa0distinctions.'];Ah, that's a common intuition, but it's also a topic of debate among philosophers. Think of it like this: knowing a recipe doesn't necessarily mean you can cook a perfect dish. You might know the steps, but executing them requires a different kind of skill. In this sense, knowing how to do something is more like having a certain kind of knowledge, rather than having the ability itself.;Professor Phil, I'm having trouble understanding how ability and knowledge are related. I mean, can we say that knowing how to do something means you have the ability to do it?

However, consider the example of a pianist who hasn't played in years and is rusty, or a language speaker who has lost their fluency due to lack of use. In these cases, it's arguable that the person still knows how to play or speak, but they've lost the ability to do so proficiently. This suggests that knowing how and having the ability might be distinct, even if they're closely related.;That makes sense, but what about skills like playing the piano or speaking a language? It feels like knowing how to do those things is the same as having the ability to do them.

This section canvasses two of the most important formal\xa0distinctions.'];Well, one approach is to distinguish between different kinds of powers or capacities that we have as agents. For example, we might distinguish between abilities, skills, and talents, and consider how each of these relates to knowledge and intelligent action. We might also explore the idea that skills and talents are not just abilities, but rather a specific kind of ability that involves a high degree of intelligent or intentional control. This is a topic that's still being explored in the literature, but it's an interesting area of inquiry that can help us shed light on the complex relationships between ability, knowledge, and intelligent action.;I see what you mean. It seems like the relationship between ability and knowledge is more complex than I initially thought. How do you think we can better understand this relationship, especially in the context of skills and talents?
"['\n The previous section was primarily concerned with distinguishing abilities from other powers. But there is also a distinction to be made within the class of abilities itself. This is the distinction between general and specific abilities .\n The distinction between general and specific abilities may be brought out by way of example. Consider a well-trained tennis player equipped with ball and racquet, standing at the service line. There is, as it were, nothing standing between her and a serve: every prerequisite for her serving has been met. Such an agent is in a position to serve, or has serving as an option. Let us say that such an agent has the specific ability to serve.\n In contrast, consider an otherwise similar tennis player who lacks a racquet and ball, and is miles away from a tennis court. There is clearly a good sense in which such an agent has the ability to hit a serve: she has been trained to do so, and has done so many times in the past. Yet such an agent lacks the specific ability to serve, as that term was just defined. Let us say that such an agent has the general ability to serve.\n The concern of this article will be general abilities in this sense, and unqualified references to ‘ability’ should be read in that way. But specific abilities will also be at issue. This is for at least two reasons.\n The first is one of coverage: many of the proposals that are relevant to the understanding of ability, especially the classical ‘conditional analysis’ (discussed in Section 3.1 below), are naturally read as proposals about specific ability in the present sense, and a suitably broad conception of ability lets us keep these proposals within our domain of discussion.\n The second reason is more properly philosophical. If we accept the distinction between general and specific abilities, then we want for our account of ability to accommodate both of them, and ultimately to explain how they are related to each other. For this distinction is not plausibly diagnosed as mere ambiguity; it rather marks off something like two modes of a single kind of power. There are at least two kinds of proposals one may make here. One, arguably implicit in many of the ‘new dispositionalist’ approaches to ability, is that general ability is in some sense prior to specific ability: to have a specific ability is simply to have a general ability and to meet some further constraint, such as having an opportunity. Another proposal  is that specific ability is in some sense prior to general ability: to have a general ability is simply to have a specific ability under a certain range of circumstances.\n The idea that there is some sort of bipartite distinction to be made between abilities has been a prominent theme in contemporary work on ability. It has been endorsed and developed, in different contexts, by Glick , Vihvelin , and Whittle . It is an open question whether the bipartite distinctions in ability introduced by these authors are the same as one another, or the same as the one introduced here. It could be that there are several bipartite distinctions to be made in this area, or that we simply have one distinction under several names.']";Ah, that's a great question. Let me use an analogy to help illustrate this. Think of an ability like a key. Having a key doesn't mean you can open a door if you're not in front of the door or if the door is locked. But having the key does mean you have the capacity to open the door under the right circumstances.;Professor, I've been thinking, when you have an ability to do something but you're not actually in a situation to do it, do you really have the ability?

The idea that the ability itself is not doing the work, but rather the circumstances that allow us to exercise the ability, is a view that has been characterized as the 'conditional analysis'. This approach suggests that having an ability is simply a matter of being in the right conditions to perform the action. However, some philosophers argue that this view doesn't fully capture the nature of ability, and that we need to make a distinction between 'general abilities' and 'specific abilities'.;But that raises another question - if having the ability is dependent on the circumstances, is the ability itself really doing the work, or is it more about the circumstances that allow us to exercise the ability?

The relationship between general and specific abilities is a matter of debate. Some argue that specific abilities are derived from general abilities, while others argue that general abilities are just a manifestation of specific abilities under different circumstances. Both views have their strengths and weaknesses.;So, you're saying that having a general ability is like having a potential, whereas having a specific ability is having that potential actualized in the current situation? But how do we make sense of the relationship between these two types of abilities?
['\n The bulk of theories of ability that have been defended in the historical and contemporary literature have been what we might call hypothetical theories. On such views, to have an ability is for it to be the case that one would act in certain ways if one were to have certain volitions. One arrives at different theories depending on how one understands the volitions in question and how exactly these actions would hypothetically depend on them, but nonetheless these views constitute something like a unified family. Given their prominence and unity, it is natural to begin our survey of theories of ability with them.'];That's an intriguing question. Imagine a skilled pianist who never plays in public. Do we say they have the ability to play the piano, regardless of whether they choose to display that talent? I'd argue that having an ability doesn't necessarily require manifesting it through action. The pianist might be simply choosing not to exercise their skill. But, isn't that choice itself reflective of their character? Doesn't that tell us something about who they are?;If actions truly show someone's character, do we actually need to see the action take place to judge that characteristic, or is the potential enough?

Just because it's not driving down the highway doesn't mean it can't drive. Its potential to drive remains, even if it's not being exercised. We can inspect its engine, its wheels, and its physical properties to determine its capabilities, just as we might assess someone's background, education, and experiences to determine their potential abilities. This gets at the idea of hypothetical theories of ability, where having an ability means it's the case that one would act in a certain way if one were to have a certain volition - in this case, the volition to play the piano or drive the car. What are your thoughts on this?;But if we can't see them play, how do we know it's not just something they claim to be able to do? Maybe they're just pretending to be skilled.
['\n There is a surprising disconnect between the way abilities have been discussed in the philosophical literature in the tradition of Hume and the way that they have been approached in more recent work in logic and linguistics. Here, ability claims are understood as categorical possibility claims: claims about what some agent does in some non-actual state of affairs (or ‘possible world’). Let a modal theory of ability be any theory on which claims about an agent’s abilities are understood in terms of claims about what that agent in fact does at some possible world (or set of worlds). The idea that some such modal theory of ability must be true is a presumption of much formal work on ability and ability-ascriptions. Yet there are serious challenges to the idea that ability is in this sense a modality.'];That's a great question. It's a bit like asking whether a car that's parked in a garage but never driven should be considered capable of moving. One way to approach this is to think of ability as a kind of potentiality that exists regardless of whether it's actualized. Just as the car has the potential to move, even if it's not currently moving, the person has the potential to play the guitar, even if they're not currently playing it.;Professor Phil, I was reading about the concept of ability and how some philosophers think about it. It made me wonder: if someone has the ability to play the guitar but never actually does, should we still consider that they have the ability?

Think of it like a branching tree of different realities, each representing a possible path that events could take. In one of those possible worlds, the person might actually be playing the guitar, and that's where we can say they've actualized their ability. But what if that world doesn't exist in our reality? Does that mean they don't have the ability after all?";But then how do we determine if someone really has that potential? Maybe they just think they can play the guitar, but they've never actually tried.

And possibility is inherently connected to potentiality, which is where ability comes in. The possible worlds idea can help us understand how to evaluate claims about ability, even when those claims aren't actualized in our reality.";Hmm, I see what you mean. But that raises another question: why should we care about what happens in these hypothetical possible worlds? Shouldn't we just focus on what's real?
['\n Intuitively, claims about ability are claims about possibility. It is in some sense a truism that someone is able to perform some act just in case it is possible for her to perform it.\n To develop this purported truism, begin with the thought that for S to have an ability to A it is necessary, but not sufficient, that it be possible that S does A. This claim will be contentious for various more specialized sorts of possibility, such as nomic possibility. But if we may help ourselves to the idea of possibility simpliciter (‘metaphysical possibility,’\xa0on at least one reading of that phrase), then this claim appears plausible. (We will survey some historical and contemporary challenges to it below in Section 4.2.) On the other hand it seems implausible that this sort of possibility is a sufficient condition: there are any number of acts that that are metaphysically possible to perform that an agent might nonetheless not be able to perform.\n This suggests a natural hypothesis. To have an ability is for it to be possible to A in some restricted sense of possibility. As nomic possibility is possibility relative to the laws of nature, and epistemic possibility is possibility relative to what an agent knows, so may ability be possibility relative to some independently specifiable set of conditions.\n To render this hypothesis precisely, we may help ourselves to the formal framework of ‘possible worlds,’ which offers an elegant and powerful semantics for modal language. On this framework, a proposition is possible just in case it is true at some possible world. We can then say an agent is able to A just in case she performs that act at some world (or set of worlds) that satisfy some independently specifiable set of conditions.\n We thus arrive at the modal analysis of ability:\n (MA) S has the ability to A iff S does A at some world (or set of worlds) satisfying condition C.\n\n (MA) is actually not itself an analysis but rather a template for a general family of analyses. Different members of this family will be distinguished by the different candidates they might propose for C, as well as whether they quantify over individual worlds or sets of worlds. Nonetheless, these analyses demonstrate sufficient theoretical unity that they may be viewed, at an appropriate level of abstraction, as a single approach to the analysis of ability.\n Two points about (MA) bear noting. First, ‘modal’ here is being used in a relatively strict and narrow way. Sometimes ‘modal’ is used loosely to describe phenomena that are connected to possibility (and necessity) in some way or other. As noted above, it is a truism that there is some connection between ability and necessity, and so that ability is in this loose sense ‘modal.’ The proponent of (MA) is concerned with modality in a stricter sense: she proposes that ability may be analyzed in terms of the precise framework of propositions and possible worlds just adumbrated. The opponent of (MA), in turn, grants that ability has something to do with possibility but denies that any such analysis succeeds.\n Second, while (MA) has been presented as an alternative to (CA), (CA) is arguably just one particular version of (MA). For, as noted above, (CA) appeals to a subjunctive conditional, and the standard semantics for the subjunctive conditional  is told in terms of quantification over possible worlds. Specifically (on Stalnaker’s version) a subjunctive conditional is true just in case its consequent is true at the world where its antecedent is true that is otherwise maximally similar to the actual world. In these terms, (CA) is roughly equivalent to the following:\n (CAmodal) S has the ability to A iff S does A at a world at which S tries to A that is otherwise maximally similar to the actual world.\n\n This is patently a version of (MA), with ‘S tries to A and is otherwise maximally similar to the actual world’ serving as condition C.\n If this is correct, then most discussions of the analysis on ability in the twentieth century have focused on a special and somewhat idiosyncratic case of a much broader program of analysis, namely the program of giving a modal analysis of ability. The considerations brought forth in the remainder of this section, in contrast, are concerned with the general case.'];Imagine you have a Lamborghini at your disposal, but you've never driven one before. It's possible for you to drive it – you just need to get in, buckle up, and press the accelerator – but would you say you have the ability to drive it? In one sense, yes – the car's engine can move, and you can operate it – but in another sense, no, because you don't possess the necessary skills and experience. This distinction often stems from how we understand 'ability.' Some argue it's not just about metaphysical possibility, but also under the right conditions or with specific limitations.;Professor, can you explain why some actions that are possible for us to do, we still consider not within our abilities?

Is it purely about physical and material constraints, or do we also take into account a person's character, knowledge, and rational capacities? To take it a step further, imagine there's someone who has the physical ability to save a child from drowning, but their psychological condition, let's say sociopathy, makes it impossible for them to do so out of concern for human life. In this case, physical possibility doesn't define their ability. How do we articulate this under the notion of ability?;That brings up something – can't we just look at specific limitations and decide from there if someone is able to do something or not?

Indeed, philosophers differentiate between internal and external limitations. A promising approach is the 'modal analysis' of ability, which addresses this question by introducing possible worlds into the discussion. Instead of solely concentrating on actual cases, it attempts to define ability across a range of hypothetical scenarios. One version of this analysis might state that 'S has the ability to A if and only if S does A at some world satisfying condition C.' The challenge then becomes defining what that condition C should look like – is it a world that's maximally similar to the actual world, or a world with different laws or moral principles? That, in itself, raises further questions.;It seems to me that some limitations come from within a person and some come from the external world. Shouldn't we find a way to categorize them?

Proponents would argue that, yes, there are many possible worlds with different versions of the same person, but ability should be determined by the person's 'counterpart' across these different worlds. But of course, this shifts the question to: which of those counterparts are similar enough to count, and how can we reconcile the prospect of competing determinate outcomes based on our perception of those counterparts?;You're saying that ability can be defined as something like, existing in a world where a certain condition is met – right? So then why wouldn't we consider a different person with similar skills existing in a different world as someone with an equally different ability?

['\n In the material mode, the modal analysis gives an account of what it is to have an ability in terms of quantification over possible worlds.

That is, ‘S is able to A’ is true just in case there is a possible world w meeting certain conditions at which S does A.

This raises the question of what a non-hypothetical and non-modal account of ability and its ascription might look like.\n Since abilities are, as noted in Section 1.1, a kind of power, one natural idea is to analyze abilities in terms of some other kind of power. This appeal may proceed in different ways. One is by appealing to dispositions, and by analyzing abilities in terms of this purportedly better-understood kind of power. Another is by departing more radically from the standard ontology of recent metaphysics, and analyzing ability in terms of some new and distinctive variety of power.

Now, your friend isn't asking if in some hypothetical world or situation where all the right conditions are met and there's a grand piano nearby that you technically could play it – they're asking about the actual capacity or ability inherent within you, right now. So that question about hypothetical situations is spot on. It does bring into question whether talking about possibilities or conditional statements is an effective way to capture what we mean by 'ability.'";I don't get it, is the capability to do something always tied to hypothetical scenarios or possible worlds?
['\n The foregoing has indicated serious concerns about the adequacy of the orthodox approaches to ability and its ascription: the conditional analysis (CA), and the modal analysis (MA), of which (CA) is arguably just a special case. This raises the question of what a non-hypothetical and non-modal account of ability and its ascription might look like.\n Since abilities are, as noted in Section 1.1, a kind of power, one natural idea is to analyze abilities in terms of some other kind of power. This appeal may proceed in different ways. One is by appealing to dispositions, and by analyzing abilities in terms of this purportedly better-understood kind of power. Another is by departing more radically from the standard ontology of recent metaphysics, and analyzing ability in terms of some new and distinctive variety of power. We will consider these approaches in turn in Sections 5.1 and'];"Exactly. That concern about hypothetical or possible scenarios in defining ability - we can play the devil's advocate here - you could ask whether there is a kind of ability that can't be captured by talk of possibilities or conditionals. Your 'I can speak English' example illustrates a rather straightforward exercise of an ability. However, examining the idea of capturing an ability like that one might require moving beyond hypothetical cases. To build on your example, researching x-ray vision - when speaking of ""I have the ability to speak English,"" we aren't pointing to conditional uses (""I can, if I wanted, in a hypothetical speaking-English scenario, speak English"") but rather to a more fundamental capacity or disposition which enables doing the action in question.";"So are they saying some abilities don't fit in those hypothetical or possible scenarios? For example, if I say ""I can speak English"" – does that mean it's because in a hypothetical situation where I am speaking English, I indeed would be able to do it?"

To come to a non-hypothetical account of the capacity to exert something in the manner you demonstrated, by mentioning being asleep, so we have examples to hold onto – consider fragility as a helpful one for understanding dispositions: a glass may have a disposition to shatter (to demonstrate an ability when conditions become opportune, like hitting it). Similarly, by adopting that kind of analysis – but extending it, our capacity for analyzing would allow us an effective digression into investigating ability that doesn't always need some hypothetical fueling scenario and rather emphasis on these real-world relates of active or passive exercise.";Speaking of dispositions and the x-ray vision example, you mentioned dispositions earlier, so I'm curious: how might an analysis of ability be accomplished in terms of dispositions? Maybe with an instance of something like being asleep - where being asleep doesn't literally mean I'm not exerting a capability even though an external viewer won't see that in operation.

What about radical departures from this existing concept of analyzing abilities, because maybe it isn't done correctly?
['\n As noted in Section 1.1, dispositions are simply one member of the broader family of powers, albeit one that has figured prominently in recent metaphysics. An alternative account of abilities might give an account of abilities in terms of some other kind of power, perhaps one better-suited to the distinctive aspects of abilities.\n One account of this kind is developed in a series of works by Barbara Vetter . Vetter proposes that our basic modal notion should be potentiality. On a traditional view (which Vetter rejects) dispositions involve a dyadic relation between a stimulus and a manifestation (for example: a glass is disposed to break when struck). In contrast, potentials involve a monadic relation to a manifestation (for example: a glass has the potential to break). This makes potentials especially well-suited to give an account of abilities, which also appear to involve a monadic relation to an act, namely the act denoted by the complement of an ability-ascription (for example: I am able to play tennis). To have an ability, Vetter argues, is simply to have a certain kind of potentiality. Vetter also provides an explicit semantics for agentive modality in terms of the ascription of potentiality , which constitutes a systematic alternative to (MA).\n Yet another view is suggested by recent work by Helen Steward emphasizing the traditional idea of a ‘two-way power’ . Steward argues that actions are exercises of two-way powers — ‘powers which an agent can exercise or not at a given moment, even holding all prior conditions at that moment fixed’ . These are to be contrasted with one-way powers, which manifest whenever their manifestation conditions are realized, as a fragile glass breaks whenever it is struck. Unlike both the new dispositionalists on the one hand and Vetter on the other, Steward sees a fundamental asymmetry between agents, who are bearers of two-way powers, and mere objects, who are are bearers only of one-way powers. It is natural then to think that what it is to have an ability is to have a two-way power of a certain kind, and that a theory of ability should follow from an account of agency and the two-way powers.\n We thus have at least three ‘power-based’ views of abilities: the new dispositionalism, Vetter’s potentiality-based view, and Steward’s two-way power-based view. It is instructive to consider how these three accounts differ with respect to two larger philosophical projects.\n One is the project of giving an analysis of modal language, including ability-ascriptions, in terms of possible worlds. The new dispositionalist rejects (CA) and (MA) but she is still, in principle, sympathetic with that project, insofar as she allows that disposition ascriptions themselves may be ultimately understood in terms of quantification over possible worlds. This kind of view is explicitly endorsed, for instance, by Smith . In contrast, Vetter is explicitly opposed to this project, while Steward’s view appears neutral on this question.\n Another is the project of arguing that agents’ abilities are, or are not, compatible with the possibility of determinism. This is a question we touched on briefly in Section 5.1. As noted there, the new dispositionalists are motivated, in part, by the project of arguing for compatibilism. In contrast, Steward is explicitly concerned to defend incompatibilism. (Vetter appears to be neutral on this question.) The question of how the analysis of ability bears on the free will debates looms over many of these discussions, and we will confront it directly and at some length below in Section 6.'];Well, I think that's a great question. When philosophers discuss abilities, they often mean it in a more fundamental sense – an ability is something that enables us to do certain things, regardless of whether we've developed that capacity through practice or if it's something we're born with. Think of it like this: having the ability to speak a language, even if you never learned it, doesn't mean you're proficient in it. You still have the capacity to learn and become proficient, though.;Professor, when we talk about abilities, are we referring to skills that can be developed over time, or is it more of an innate capacity?

Now, that's a perspective that Barbara Vetter would likely support. She argues that abilities should be understood in terms of potentiality, rather than dispositions. According to Vetter, dispositions require a specific stimulus to be triggered, whereas potentials don't. They just exist, regardless of the environment.;That's interesting. So, the manifestation of an ability isn't as important as the potential itself?

However, I think the idea of two-way powers, as proposed by Helen Steward, offers a more nuanced view of abilities, especially when it comes to agency. Two-way powers imply a capacity for self-directed action, whereas talents might be seen as more innate, even if not necessarily 'one-way.';That reminds me of the concept of 'talent.' Is the idea of potentiality related to our understanding of talent?

By seeing agents as bearers of two-way powers, she emphasizes our capacity for self-directed action and our ability to make choices. In a sense, that understanding of agency can be seen as a counterbalance to determinism.;Isn't that a deterministic perspective, limiting us to certain capabilities based on our essential nature?

While Vetter's view and the new dispositionalism both offer compelling perspectives, I think Steward's emphasis on agency and two-way powers offers the most promising route for understanding the relationship between free will and abilities. The real challenge, however, lies in exploring how these perspectives intersect with our broader philosophical projects – like the analysis of modal language and the question of determinism.;So, which perspective on abilities do you think aligns best with the concept of free will – the dispositional, Vetter's potentiality-based view, or Steward's two-way power-based view?
['\n Still other approaches to ability reject (CA) and (MA) while rejecting also the thought that some appeal to power — be it a disposition, a potentiality, or a two-way power — is needed to account for abilities.\n One recurrent thought is that, despite the various challenges that have been brought against it, ability is still intimately connected to some kind of relation between an agent’s volitions (tryings, intendings) and her actions. One semantically sophisticated development of this thought is Mandelkern et al, 2017, which proposes to take as basic a notion of ‘practically available actions,’ and to develop in terms of these a semantics for agentive modality, one on which conditionals linking volitions to actions continue to play an essential role. Another approach, in a recent book-length treatment of ability , proposes that abilities should be thought of in terms of proportions of cases where an agent successfully does what she intends to do . Both of these approaches are explicit in their denial of (CA), but they share — with the new dispositionalists — the thought that the analysis of ability should somehow appeal to a pattern of dependence between volition and action.\n This is not surprising. The conditional analysis is a redoubtable proposal, endorsed by many of the major figures in English-language philosophy. In light of that, it seems reasonable to try to discard the letter of (CA), but retain its spirit. For it may be that the historical failure of (CA) is due to difficulties and oversights that our perhaps firmer grasp of technical issues allows us to overcome. This is a sensible and well-motivated project, though it remains to be seen whether it will be, in the end, a successful one.\n There remain still other accounts that do not fit easily into the taxonomy provided here. These include primitivist proposals, which take ability or some closely related notion as analytically fundamental. One development of this idea is Maier 2015, who proposes, contrary to most authors, that specific ability is fundamentally prior to general ability. He argues that we should give an account of general ability in terms of specific abilities, which he calls ‘options’: roughly, an agent has the general ability to A iff she normally has A as an option. Options, in turn, are primitives. Much here will hang on saying more about options, and in what sense they figure as primitives in the theory of agency.\n Finally, an outline of a proposal by David Lewis  offers an altogether different approach to ability. Lewis is motivated, like many proponents of (CA), by the goal of defending compatibilism, but he takes (CA) to be unsatisfactory. He therefore proposes a non-conditional analysis of ability. His analysis, roughly, is that S has the ability to perform an action B just in case there is some basic action A such that (i) S’s doing A would cause or constitute S’s doing B and (ii) there is no obstacle to S’s doing A. The problem of giving a theory of ability then becomes the problem of giving a theory of obstacles, something at which Lewis, in his outline, makes a beginning. .\n Lewis’s proposal is an inspiration for further research in at least two ways. First, it indicates that Lewis, a systematic philosopher of modality, saw the problem of giving an analysis of ability as a significant outstanding project. Second, it demonstrates that genuinely novel approaches to ability remain available, and the project of giving a theory of ability may yet be in its early stages.'];Not exactly. Think of it like owning a set of golf clubs. Just because you own the clubs doesn't mean you can hit a hole-in-one. However, it's the potential to use the clubs effectively that makes owning them valuable. In a similar way, having an ability doesn't mean you're currently using it, but rather you have the capacity to do so.;Professor Phil, I've been trying to understand the concept of ability, and I was wondering, is having the ability to do something the same as actually being able to do it?

Consider the analogy of a car. If the car's engine is functioning correctly, it can move forward when the driver intends to accelerate. This connection between the driver's intention and the car's movement is similar to how some philosophers think about ability – as a link between our volitions and actions. However, this is a subject of ongoing debate, and there are different approaches to analyzing ability.;So, does that mean that ability is connected to our intentions, like trying or wanting to do something?

The problem of giving a theory of ability then becomes the problem of giving a theory of obstacles, something at which Lewis, in his outline, makes a beginning. .\n Lewis’s proposal is an inspiration for further research in at least two ways. First, it indicates that Lewis, a systematic philosopher of modality, saw the problem of giving an analysis of ability as a significant outstanding project. Second, it demonstrates that genuinely novel approaches to ability remain available, and the project of giving a theory of ability may yet be in its early stages.'];That's a proposal that has been put forward, where ability is thought of in terms of proportions of cases where an agent successfully does what she intends to do. However, the issue is more complicated than that. For instance, imagine a skilled sniper who only hits their target 90% of the time. Does that mean they're less able to shoot accurately than someone who hits their target every single time, but only in controlled environments? The relationship between ability and successful action is complex and depends on various factors.;I'm not sure I understand why it's a debate. Wouldn't it make sense to define ability in terms of how many times we successfully do something we intend to do?
['\n Still other approaches to ability reject (CA) and (MA) while rejecting also the thought that some appeal to power — be it a disposition, a potentiality, or a two-way power — is needed to account for abilities.\n One recurrent thought is that, despite the various challenges that have been brought against it, ability is still intimately connected to some kind of relation between an agent’s volitions (tryings, intendings) and her actions. One semantically sophisticated development of this thought is Mandelkern et al, 2017, which proposes to take as basic a notion of ‘practically available actions,’ and to develop in terms of these a semantics for agentive modality, one on which conditionals linking volitions to actions continue to play an essential role. Another approach, in a recent book-length treatment of ability , proposes that abilities should be thought of in terms of proportions of cases where an agent successfully does what she intends to do . Both of these approaches are explicit in their denial of (CA), but they share — with the new dispositionalists — the thought that the analysis of ability should somehow appeal to a pattern of dependence between volition and action.\n This is not surprising. The conditional analysis is a redoubtable proposal, endorsed by many of the major figures in English-language philosophy. In light of that, it seems reasonable to try to discard the letter of (CA), but retain its spirit. For it may be that the historical failure of (CA) is due to difficulties and oversights that our perhaps firmer grasp of technical issues allows us to overcome. This is a sensible and well-motivated project, though it remains to be seen whether it will be, in the end, a successful one.\n There remain still other accounts that do not fit easily into the taxonomy provided here. These include primitivist proposals, which take ability or some closely related notion as analytically fundamental. One development of this idea is Maier 2015, who proposes, contrary to most authors, that specific ability is fundamentally prior to general ability. He argues that we should give an account of general ability in terms of specific abilities, which he calls ‘options’: roughly, an agent has the general ability to A iff she normally has A as an option. Options, in turn, are primitives. Much here will hang on saying more about options, and in what sense they figure as primitives in the theory of agency.\n Finally, an outline of a proposal by David Lewis  offers an altogether different approach to ability. Lewis is motivated, like many proponents of (CA), by the goal of defending compatibilism, but he takes (CA) to be unsatisfactory. He therefore proposes a non-conditional analysis of ability. His analysis, roughly, is that S has the ability to perform an action B just in case there is some basic action A such that (i) S’s doing A would cause or constitute S’s doing B and (ii) there is no obstacle to S’s doing A.

Second, it demonstrates that genuinely novel approaches to ability remain available, and the project of giving a theory of ability may yet be in its early stages.'];Ah, that raises an interesting point. Consider the model proposed by David Lewis, which defines ability in terms of the absence of obstacles to performing an action. This approach emphasizes that ability is not just about internal capabilities, but also about external conditions. In cases where someone is forced to act against their will, you could argue that their ability to perform the action is not diminished, but rather, there's an external obstacle preventing them from exercising their ability.;I see what you mean. It's like how in sports, having a high batting average doesn't guarantee a player will hit every ball thrown at them. But what about cases where someone doesn't have control over their actions, like being forced to do something?

Lewis's proposal does invite further exploration of what constitutes an obstacle and how it affects our understanding of ability. This is an area where ongoing philosophical inquiry can deepen our understanding of this concept. Remember, the project of giving a theory of ability is complex and continuously evolving, and it's the back-and-forth discussions like ours that help us move forward in our understanding.;That makes sense, I think. But it also seems like this approach opens up more questions, like how do we define obstacles?
['There are not many sources on the life of Abner. The majority of the sources are autobiographical passages in his works (especially Mostrador de Justicia). Abner was born around 1260, probably in the Jewish community of Burgos, one of the major communities in Castile. While still Jewish, Abner worked as a book trader, a rabbi, and he may have been a physician as well. During this time he was the head of a yeshiva (Jewish academy) in Burgos, but we do not know if this yeshiva was a public institution or just a private group of students that met in his home. We know from a former pupil, Rabbi Isaac Pulgar, and from the sources that he utilizes in his works, that during the Jewish period of his life, Abner was a philosopher, being a part of the Maimonidean-Averroist trend of Jewish philosophy at the time.\n In spite of the majority opinion of modern  scholars,  Abner probably was not a Kabbalist before his conversion to Christianity. This mistake is based essentially on two sources: the fact that some of Abner’s arguments for the Trinity and Incarnation can be interpreted as deriving from Kabbalistic sources, and the existence of another Rabbi Abner (not a common name for Jews of his time), a Kabbalist whom Rabbi Isaac of Acre cited many times. In my opinion, Abner’s argument for the Trinity and Incarnation is not based on Kabbalistic sources, but stems from his Neo-Platonic and standard Christian scriptural  background.  Additionally, Abner (the apostate) did not use many important Kabbalistic  sources.  His opinions are not the same as the other Rabbi Abner’s (the one that Rabbi Isaac of Acre quotes), and we can see that the two authors do not share the same background, nor do they use the same sources, with Abner utilizing almost entirely sources taken from the Jewish philosophical and traditional rabbinic  corpuses.  almost all of Rabbi Abner’s sources are taken from the commentary of Nahmanides to the Torah, a book that Abner the apostate almost never quoted. \n The beginning of Abner’s doubts about Judaism began with the incident of a false messiah in Avila in 1295. According to Abner, the Jews of the community, which is in North Castile, went outside the city to welcome the messiah, but instead of the messiah they received a rainfall of crosses that stuck to their clothes. Some of the Jews who witnessed the miracle went to Abner for advice. This event instilled in Abner some doubts about the question of the reason for the ongoing exile of Israel and the truth of Judaism. After twenty-two years of feeling ambivalent  Abner wrote about his first revelation in a  dream.  In his dream he saw a man that told him to be “a teacher of righteousness” (mostrador de justicia, not coincidentally the name of Abner’s main book) and to bring his people to freedom from exile. This dream just accents the uncertainty of the Jewish Rabbi. After three more years of studies he had a second dream wherein he had the same revelation, this time noticing that on the clothes the man wore were crosses like the cross of Jesus the Christian. This dream prompted him toward his final conversion around 1320/1321. After his conversion, Abner became the sacristan of the collegiate church of Valladolid and devoted himself to the propagation of Christianity amongst his former fellows Jews (he had come to the conclusion that conversion to Christianity was the only way to be saved from the Exile). We know he wrote an extended polemicist oeuvre and that he took part in the anti-Jewish polemic effort in North Castile around 1336–1339. There was a public disputation between Abner and a rabbi that occurred probably around 1335–1336 on the subject of the prayer of the Jews against the apostates. This dispute was the main reason for the decree against this part of the Jewish prayer (birkatha-minim) by Alfonso XI in 1336. Abner probably died in 1347 or later.'];That's a thought-provoking question. I'd like to use the analogy of a riverbed. Imagine a river that's been flowing through a specific channel for years, carving out a deep path. The river's course represents our deeply ingrained beliefs and values. Now, what if a massive storm hits, causing a massive flood? The river might change course, flowing through new channels and creating a new path. This storm can be seen as a significant life event that challenges our existing worldview, forcing us to re-evaluate our beliefs and potentially leading to a transformation. However, it's also possible that even with such a significant event, the river might still return to its original course.;Professor Phil, is it possible for someone to change their deep-seated beliefs and values drastically, and if so, what triggers this kind of transformation?

In fact, the people around us can be the storm that changes the river's course. Think of it like this: we're often part of a collective, a community that shares similar values and beliefs. However, sometimes we're confronted with alternative perspectives or people who challenge our views. This can create a sense of cognitive dissonance, which can lead to us re-evaluating our own beliefs and values. But, as the devil's advocate, I'd argue that it's also possible for individuals to resist this change, to cling to their existing worldview, even in the face of conflicting information or alternative perspectives.;That's an interesting analogy. So, you're saying that significant life events can lead to a change in our deep-seated beliefs. But what about the people around us? Can they also play a role in this transformation?

Think of it like this: imagine you're a chef who's been working with a specific set of ingredients and recipes for years. You've built a reputation on your culinary skills, and your dishes are deeply rooted in your cultural heritage. Now, imagine you're introduced to entirely new ingredients and cooking techniques that change your approach to culinary art. Are you still the same chef, or are you someone entirely new? In the case of conversion, the individual might not necessarily reject their past identity but rather reinterpret it through the lens of their new faith. They might integrate their past experiences and knowledge into their new worldview, drawing parallels between the two and finding ways to reconcile their dual identities.;I see what you mean. So, how does someone who's undergone a significant transformation, let's say a conversion to a new faith, reconcile their past and present selves? Do they completely reject their past identity, or is there a way to integrate their new beliefs with their past experiences?

"['\n Abner’s works may be divided into three different categories: polemic, scientific and philosophic.\n Polemic works: Mostradorde Justicia is the earliest and most important work of those writings of Abner that have survived. Only a translation (probably by Abner himself) in Castilian exists today, whereas the original Hebrew was lost. The book starts with a brief introduction wherein Abner writes about the reasons for his conversion (the incident in Avila and his two dreams). The main part of the book is a debate between a Christian (the master) and a Jew (the rebel). In contrast to other works similar to this type of polemic debate, in the Mostrador, the rebel does not become a Christian, and despite his losing the debate, the Jew continues to believe in his ostensibly false religion. The book is divided into ten chapters, with each chapter being subdivided into a number of paragraphs. Each paragraph is a speech by one of the protagonists of the  debate.\n Summary of the chapters:\n Responses to the Blasphemer (Teshuvot la-Meharef): this book survived both in the original  Hebrew  and in a Castilian  translation.  This book is a response to the different letters that Abner’s only known student, Rabbi Isaac Pulgar, wrote against his determinist and Christian  writings.  Abner did not divide this book into formal sections, though the book contains four main subjects presented in a contiguous fashion: (1) an introduction wherein Abner attacks his former pupil on his philosophical position and other personal matters between the two; (2) the Trinity and how it can be based on philosophy, scripture and quotes from the Jewish rabbinic literature; (3) the necessary existence of the incarnation of divinity in the world; and (4) a proof of the aforementioned Christian beliefs derived from scripture and other Jewish sources (Talmud and Midrashim). In this last part, which takes up almost half the book, Abner argues that the messiah had already come and that Christianity is true.\n While Abner’s arguments regarding the Trinity and Incarnation are generally more developed in Mostradorde Justicia, the philosophical importance of this work resides with his critique of the Jewish philosopher. Here Abner distinguishes between the regular Jewish people (that have some hope to become Christian and to be saved) and Jewish philosophers (like Pulgar). The latter are hopeless and are left with no religion, mostly due to their opinions that only the people who attain scientific knowledge have some kind of existence after death. Due to their feeling elevated over others, these philosophers have no hope of improving and accepting the truth of Christianity. Parts of Abner’s critique of Jewish philosophers in this book most probably influenced Crescas.\n Libro de la Ley (Book of the Law). This work survived only  fragmentally  in Castilian.

In Mostradorde Justicia, Abner presents a debate between a Christian and a Jew. Now, typically, these debates follow a predictable pattern: one side presents an argument, the other side counters, and ultimately, the 'losing' side sees the light and converts. But not in Mostradorde Justicia - the Jewish 'rebel' loses the debate but still refuses to accept Christianity. This is noteworthy, as it adds a layer of complexity to the typical polemic format, almost making the debate a mirror reflection of real life where we encounter diverse perspectives and oftentimes, no side sees immediate victory. Let me ask you this: do we ever come across any real debates that can truly claim such results where no change of fundamental stance is seen after or even during deliberation or negotiation?;Professor Phil, I was reading about Abner and his polemic works.

"['\n Abner’s works may be divided into three different categories: polemic, scientific and philosophic.\n Polemic works: Mostradorde Justicia is the earliest and most important work of those writings of Abner that have survived. Only a translation (probably by Abner himself) in Castilian exists today, whereas the original Hebrew was lost. The book starts with a brief introduction wherein Abner writes about the reasons for his conversion (the incident in Avila and his two dreams). The main part of the book is a debate between a Christian (the master) and a Jew (the rebel). In contrast to other works similar to this type of polemic debate, in the Mostrador, the rebel does not become a Christian, and despite his losing the debate, the Jew continues to believe in his ostensibly false religion. The book is divided into ten chapters, with each chapter being subdivided into a number of paragraphs. Each paragraph is a speech by one of the protagonists of the  debate.\n Summary of the chapters:\n Responses to the Blasphemer (Teshuvot la-Meharef): this book survived both in the original  Hebrew  and in a Castilian  translation.  This book is a response to the different letters that Abner’s only known student, Rabbi Isaac Pulgar, wrote against his determinist and Christian  writings.  Abner did not divide this book into formal sections, though the book contains four main subjects presented in a contiguous fashion: (1) an introduction wherein Abner attacks his former pupil on his philosophical position and other personal matters between the two; (2) the Trinity and how it can be based on philosophy, scripture and quotes from the Jewish rabbinic literature; (3) the necessary existence of the incarnation of divinity in the world; and (4) a proof of the aforementioned Christian beliefs derived from scripture and other Jewish sources (Talmud and Midrashim). In this last part, which takes up almost half the book, Abner argues that the messiah had already come and that Christianity is true.\n While Abner’s arguments regarding the Trinity and Incarnation are generally more developed in Mostradorde Justicia, the philosophical importance of this work resides with his critique of the Jewish philosopher. Here Abner distinguishes between the regular Jewish people (that have some hope to become Christian and to be saved) and Jewish philosophers (like Pulgar). The latter are hopeless and are left with no religion, mostly due to their opinions that only the people who attain scientific knowledge have some kind of existence after death. Due to their feeling elevated over others, these philosophers have no hope of improving and accepting the truth of Christianity.

In Mostradorde Justicia, Abner presents a debate between a Christian and a Jew. Now, typically, these debates follow a predictable pattern: one side presents an argument, the other side counters, and ultimately, the 'losing' side sees the light and converts. But not in Mostradorde Justicia - the Jewish 'rebel' loses the debate but still refuses to accept Christianity. This is noteworthy, as it adds a layer of complexity to the typical polemic format.;Professor Phil, I was reading about Abner and his polemic works. What's interesting about his writing style, particularly in Mostradorde Justicia?

Abner's other works, such as Responses to the Blasphemer, also deal with the relationship between Christianity and Judaism. However, in these works, Abner takes a more critical approach, arguing that Jewish philosophers are unable to accept Christianity due to their narrow focus on scientific knowledge. He sees this as a limitation, as it prevents them from understanding the true nature of God.;That's really interesting. It sounds like Abner is trying to present a more nuanced view of the debate between Christianity and Judaism. But what about his other works? How do they compare to Mostradorde Justicia?

Abner's views on the Trinity and the Incarnation are central to his philosophical project. He argues that the Trinity can be understood through reason and scripture, and that the Incarnation is necessary for human salvation. However, he also acknowledges that these concepts are complex and difficult to understand, and that they require a deep understanding of scripture and tradition.;I see. So Abner is trying to challenge the Jewish philosophical tradition, while also presenting a more nuanced view of the debate between Christianity and Judaism. What about his views on the Trinity and the Incarnation? How do they fit into his overall philosophical project?
['\n One must distinguish between two kinds of influence Abner had. Abner influenced with his polemical works the Jewish-Christian debate until the end of the Middle Ages. Some born-Christians, like Alfonso de Espina, and especially Jewish apostates, like Pablo de Santa Maria, utilized his polemical works. Against this trend, there are more than five Jewish polemicist works that explicitly answer the polemical arguments of  Abner.  Despite the utilization of Abner in debates, his works had almost no philosophical influence on Christian theology because the Christian participants in the debates utilized the quotations of the Jewish sources by Abner and not his theological arguments as such, which in their content were very different from the official Catholic dogma.\n The second way in which Abner had lasting influence was on the purely philosophical plane. It should be noted that the direct philosophical influence of Abner was only on the Jewish community. In fact we do not see that any Christian philosophers read the works of Jewish apostates in any other forum apart from the purely polemical one. By contrast, in the Jewish community the works of Abner had an important impact until the expulsion of the Jews from Spain in 1492. The deterministic opinion of Abner is with no doubt one of the major causes to the extensive number of works written on this subject in the 14th and 15th centuries by Jewish philosophers. For the most part, these works were against the opinion of Abner. The most impressive philosophical influence of Abner was on Rabbi Hasdai Crescas . Crescas was the main Jewish philosopher during the end of the Middle Ages. Despite their opposite positions in the Jewish-Christian debate (Crescas wrote one of the more philosophical anti-Christian  works),  Crescas borrowed some of the major original philosophical opinions of Abner, including determinism, the difference between the attributes of the essence and the attributes that are essential, and the criticism of Aristotelian science. With regard to this entire subject, Crescas molded his opinion using Abner combined with other sources. In spite of this important change, we can clearly see signs of the philosophy of Abner in the writing of Crescas, and these signs constitute nearly all the post medieval influence of Abner on Jewish and general Western philosophy.'];That's a fascinating topic. It's almost like the idea of a meme, where a concept or phrase can be transmitted and evolve through a culture, taking on different meanings and connotations along the way. Just because someone's idea is influential, doesn't mean it's being used in a way that's true to their original intention.;Professor Phil, I've been thinking about the concept of intellectual influence, and how it's not always a straightforward process. I mean, someone's ideas can be used by others, but not necessarily in the way they intended.

I'd say that's definitely possible. Just because someone's ideas are being used in a debate, doesn't mean they're having a profound impact on the philosophical underpinnings of the debate. It's like the difference between a tactic and a strategy. The tactic might be useful in a particular debate, but the strategy – the underlying philosophical approach – might remain unchanged.;Exactly. And it got me thinking about the relationship between polemical debates and philosophical influence. Can someone's ideas be influential in a debate, but not have a lasting impact on the underlying philosophical ideas?

I'd argue that yes, that can be a significant kind of influence. Just because someone's ideas aren't universally accepted, doesn't mean they're not having a profound impact on a particular community or tradition. It's like the idea of a catalyst in chemistry – a substance that speeds up a reaction, but isn't necessarily part of the final product. Someone's ideas can catalyze a whole new direction in thought within a particular community, even if they're not widely accepted outside of it.;That makes sense. But what about when someone's ideas do have a lasting impact on philosophical thought, but only within a specific community or tradition? Is that still a significant kind of influence?

['There exists a large debate in the secondary literature concerning the place and role of Jews in Renaissance culture. One group envisages a synthesis between Jewish culture on the one hand, and the ideals of the Renaissance on the  other.   Jews, according to this interpretation, could quite easily remain Jewish while still sharing in the values and culture of non-Jewish society. Another group, however, maintains that such a synthesis is historically untenable because Jews remained a small, persecuted minority left to the whims of various local  governments.   These two approaches leave us with radically different conceptions of Renaissance Jewish philosophers. According to the first approach, a Jewish intellectual could quite easily partake of the ideals and categories of Renaissance Humanism and Neoplatonism. According to the second approach, however, such a synthesis could never occur, and, as a result, most Renaissance Jewish thinkers were more indebted to the legacy of Maimonides than the various trajectories of Renaissance thought. A more productive approach, however, exists between these two: The Italian Renaissance provided certain elite Jews with new literary genres, intellectual categories, and educational ideals with which to mine the depths of their tradition.'];"That's a great question. It reminds me of a musical orchestra. Imagine a violinist who wants to join a jazz band, but they were classically trained. They can certainly learn jazz and incorporate it into their playing, but they won't forget how to play a Mozart concerto. In a similar way, individuals from minority cultures can adapt to the dominant culture without completely losing their own unique ""melody."" However, this raises questions about the extent to which they can truly blend in. Can the violinist genuinely become a jazz musician, or will they always be a classical musician playing jazz?";Professor Phil, I was wondering, can people from different cultures or backgrounds really blend in with the dominant culture without losing their own identity?

In that case, the analogy breaks down a bit. It's not just the violinist learning jazz, but also the orchestra director forbidding them from playing their classical pieces. The individual may have to resort to playing their traditional music in secret, or find ways to subtly incorporate it into the dominant culture. This kind of tension can lead to interesting creative fusions, but it also raises questions about authenticity and cultural appropriation. Consider the example of a Jewish philosopher living during the Renaissance. Could they truly engage with the dominant humanist ideals, or would they be forced to maintain a separate, hidden cultural identity?;That makes sense, I think. But what if the society they're in doesn't want them to blend in? What if they're actively trying to suppress their culture?

Philosophers like Maimonides had a profound impact on Jewish thought, and their ideas continued to resonate with Jewish intellectuals during the Renaissance. To abandon their cultural heritage entirely would be to dismiss a rich tradition of thought and experience. Instead, these philosophers might use the new literary genres and intellectual categories available to them to re-examine and reinterpret their own tradition. It's a bit like the violinist taking jazz harmonies and applying them to classical music, creating something new and innovative while still honoring their roots.;I never thought about it that way. But wouldn't it be easier for the Jewish philosopher to just adopt the dominant culture and forget about their own background?
['\n\n The only major work that we possess of Judah Abrabanel is the Dialoghi d’amore. There is some debate as to when the work was actually written. Many point to the year 1501–1502 owing to a phrase in the third book: “According to the Jewish tradition, we are in the year 5262 from the beginning of creation” (Siamo, secondo la veritá ebraica, a cinque milia ducento sessanta due del principio de la  creazione).   The year 5262 of the Jewish calendar corresponds to 1501–1502 of the Gregorian calendar. Yet, manuscripts other than that based on the 1535 edition have the date of 5272 . This is significant because many who argue that the Dialoghi could not possibly have been written in Italian point to the fact that Judah would not have been fluent in Italian. Yet, if we assume the 1511–1512 date to be correct this would place him in Italy for close to twenty years, more than enough time to gain proficiency in Italian (especially given the fact that he would have already known at least one Spanish vernacular and, as a physician, Latin).\n\n We also know that Judah wrote poetry (see the poem quoted above). In addition to his biographical poem, he also composed poetic introductions to three of his father’s last works: Rosh Amanah, Zevach Pesach, and Nachalat Avot.\n\n Finally, we possess a letter dating to 1566 from one Amatus Lusitanus, a physician who wrote that he attended to a patient by the name of Judah “who was the grandson of the great Platonic philosopher, known as Judah or Leon Abrabanel, who gave to us the most beautiful dialogues on love.” Further in this letter, he mentions that Judah also composed a work entitled De Coeli Harmonia (“On the Harmony of the Spheres”) and that, according to the introduction, he dedicated it to the “divine Pico della Mirandola.” Unfortunately, this work has not survived. If he dedicated to Pico as the letter indicates, it would most likely have been composed before the Dialoghi and also, based on the title, it would have been composed in Latin.'];Not necessarily. Think of language as a tool, like a hammer. Just because a carpenter is from a certain region, it doesn't mean they can't use a hammer that's commonly used in another region. In fact, many scholars during the Renaissance were fluent in multiple languages. It just depends on the individual's experiences and opportunities. Judah Abrabanel, for instance, was a physician, so he would have likely been familiar with Latin, which was widely used in academic and professional circles at the time.;Professor Phil, I was reading about this author, and I found it strange that a lot of his work is in Italian when he's not from Italy. Do you think that's weird?

If he dedicated to Pico as the letter indicates, it would most likely have been composed before the Dialoghi and also, based on the title, it would have been composed in Latin.'];That's a great point. Family background can indeed shape one's worldviews and intellectual pursuits. Imagine being part of a family that values knowledge and philosophical inquiry. It's like growing up in a household where music is a big part of family gatherings. Even if you don't become a professional musician, you'll likely have a deeper appreciation for music and possibly even develop some musical skills yourself. Similarly, Judah Abrabanel's upbringing would have exposed him to various intellectual and philosophical traditions, which could have influenced his writing.;That makes sense. But what about his family background? I read that his father was a famous philosopher. Do you think that had an influence on his work?
['\n\n The only major work that we possess of Judah Abrabanel is the Dialoghi d’amore. There is some debate as to when the work was actually written.

Poetry and philosophy have long been intertwined. In fact, many philosophers throughout history have written poetry as a way to express complex ideas in a more lyrical and accessible way. Think of poetry as a different lens through which to view the world. It can offer a unique perspective on philosophical concepts, making them more relatable and engaging.;I see what you mean. But what about his poetry? I read that he wrote poetry in addition to his philosophical works. Do you think that's unusual?

It's possible that Judah Abrabanel was influenced by the works of other thinkers who wrote about the harmony of the spheres. The dedication to Pico della Mirandola is also telling, as it suggests that Judah valued Pico's ideas and might have seen himself as part of a broader intellectual community. Even though the work itself is lost, we can still learn about Judah's intellectual interests and values through the fragments of information we have about it.;"That's a great point. I never thought about it that way. What about his work ""On the Harmony of the Spheres""? I read that it's lost, but it seemed interesting. Do you know anything about it?"

If he wrote it in 1511-1512, as some argue, that would mean he had spent more time in Italy, which could have affected his fluency in Italian and the content of his work.;I feel like I have a better sense of Judah Abrabanel as a thinker now. But what about the debates surrounding the date of his Dialoghi d'amore? I read that there's some disagreement about when it was written.

"['\n\n The central question concerning the language of the Dialoghi’s composition is: How could a Jewish refugee from Portugal show such facility with Italian, let alone the Tuscan dialect, since Judah seems to have spent very little time in  Tuscany?   Those who argue for a Latin original point to the fact that (1) he was a physician and would have known Latin, and (2) a phrase by Yosef Shlomo Delmedigo  in his Mikhtav Ahuz suggesting that he was going to translate Judah’s work from Latin. Those who argue for a Hebrew original point to another phrase, this time by Claudio Tolemei , a non-Jew, which states that Judah composed his treatise in sua lingua (“his own language”).  Although, as others have pointed out, such a phrase could quite easily refer to “his own style.”\n\n However, given the evidence, an Italian original for the work seems most likely since (1) all the manuscripts, including Mariano Lenzi’s edition of 1535, are in Italian; (2) it seems that Judah had lived in Italy for close to twenty years by the time that he wrote the Dialoghi (more than enough time for someone to gain an intimate knowledge of Italian, especially someone proficient in Latin and Spanish vernaculars); (3) neither later Jewish authors, e.g., Azaria   de’Rossi,  nor non-Jewish authors, e.g., Tullia  d’Aragona, had any reason to suspect that it was written in a language other than Italian; (4) if we assume the later date of 1511–1512, many non-Tuscan Italian authors of this period called for the adoption of Tuscan as a literary language, owing primarily to the fact that this was the language of Petrarch  and Boccaccio  ;  and, (5) as for the question of the Tuscan dialect of the work, many Italian printers of the early sixteenth century “Tuscanized” Italian according to set  criteria.\n\n Moreover, many Jewish authors in the fifteenth- and sixteenth-centuries increasingly resorted to Romance vernaculars in order to attract a Jewish audience (including conversos and ex-conversos), which no longer understood Hebrew. In sixteenth-century Italy, larger trends in rhetoric and the use of language increasingly led to the creation of the ideal of a pure Italian language. In this regard, Judah becomes an important transitional thinker in the encounter between Judaism and the Italian Renaissance.

Think of it like a skilled musician who can play multiple instruments. Just as a musician can learn to master a new instrument, a writer can develop proficiency in a new language. But, just like a musician might always have a natural inclination towards their native instrument, a writer's native language can shape their writing style and voice. However, it's certainly possible for someone to adapt and create something remarkable in a non-native language. Consider the example of Joseph Conrad, who wrote masterpieces in English despite it being his third language.;Professor Phil, I was thinking about how people write in different languages, especially back in the old days when there were so many languages and dialects around. Do you think it's possible for someone to write a great work in a language they didn't grow up with?

It's like trying to recreate a local recipe without being familiar with the specific ingredients and cooking techniques of that region. You might get close, but you might also miss out on some of the subtle flavors and textures that make the dish truly authentic. That being said, a skilled writer can still learn to approximate the dialect and adapt it to their own voice, especially if they've spent a significant amount of time immersed in that culture. Think of it like a painter who can learn to mimic the style of another artist, but ultimately, their own unique perspective and brushstrokes will still shine through.;That's really interesting. But what about dialects? I mean, it's one thing to learn a new language, but what if you're trying to write in a specific dialect that's not your own? Is it harder to capture the nuances and idiosyncrasies of a dialect you're not familiar with?

"['\n\n In the thought of Judah Abrabanel, the concepts of beauty (bellezza) and love (amore) become technical terms through which he examines virtually every traditional philosophical issue. Frequently, however, his discussion of one of these terms is predicated on the existence of the other; as a result, beauty and love are inseparable in the Dialoghi, undoubtedly mirroring Judah’s understanding of the way in which these two principles operate in the universe. The intimate relationship between these two principles may be witnessed in his definition of beauty as that “which delights the mind that recognizes it and moves it to love” (dilettando l’animo col suo conoscimento, il muove ad   amare).  Without Beauty, in other words, the intellect is unable to desire something outside of itself and, thus, it is effectively unable to cognize. Judah subsequently argues that the lower senses (i.e., taste, smell or touch) cannot grasp Beauty; only the higher senses (e.g., sight and hearing) can—in addition, of course, to the imagination and the  intellect.   Moreover, since Beauty is mirrored throughout the universe, physical objects (notes, melodies, etc.) both participate in and point the way towards this incorporeal Beauty:\n\n Beauty is only found in the objects of sight (oggetti del viso), such as beautiful forms and shapes and beautiful pictures, the perfect symmetry of the parts with the whole, well-proportioned limbs, beautiful colors and clear light, the sun, the moon and the stars, and the heavens in all their splendor. This grace exists in objects of sight by reason of their spiritual nature, and it is the custom to enter through the clear and spiritual eyes, to delight our soul and move it to a love of such an object; and this is what it is that we call beauty. It is also found in objects of hearing, such as beautiful oratory, voices, speech, song music, consonance, proportion and harmony. For in the spiritual nature of these things is found grace which moves the soul to delight and to love through the medium of the spiritual sense of hearing. Thus grace and beauty are found among beautiful things that are endowed with a spiritual nature (sensi   spirituali).\n\n Based on this and other passages, Judah argues that it is primarily by means of the beauty of created things that the individual is able to apprehend and move towards incorporeal or spiritual Beauty.

Let me try to frame it in a different way. Imagine you're listening to a beautiful piece of music. The melody is harmonious, the rhythm is soothing, and the overall effect is just mesmerizing. In this scenario, would you say that your love for the music is a reaction to its beauty, or is your experience of its beauty actually shaped by your love for it?

If you're not paying attention to the music, then you're not really experiencing its beauty, and as a result, your love for it isn't triggered. This suggests that beauty can be seen as a kind of objective property of the music itself, but our experience of it is still dependent on our subjective experience. It's almost as if our love for the music is what brings its beauty into focus. To take it a step further, imagine that someone who doesn't have a musical background hears the same piece of music. They might not appreciate its beauty or respond to it with love in the same way that you do. What does that say about the relationship between beauty and love?;Hmm, I'm not sure. I think maybe the beauty of the music comes first, and then I respond to it with love. But what if I'm not really paying attention to the music, and I'm just going through the motions?

Moreover, since Beauty is mirrored throughout the universe, physical objects (notes, melodies, etc.) both participate in and point the way towards this incorporeal Beauty:\n\n Beauty is only found in the objects of sight (oggetti del viso), such as beautiful forms and shapes and beautiful pictures, the perfect symmetry of the parts with the whole, well-proportioned limbs, beautiful colors and clear light, the sun, the moon and the stars, and the heavens in all their splendor. This grace exists in objects of sight by reason of their spiritual nature, and it is the custom to enter through the clear and spiritual eyes, to delight our soul and move it to a love of such an object; and this is what it is that we call beauty. It is also found in objects of hearing, such as beautiful oratory, voices, speech, song music, consonance, proportion and harmony. For in the spiritual nature of these things is found grace which moves the soul to delight and to love through the medium of the spiritual sense of hearing. Thus grace and beauty are found among beautiful things that are endowed with a spiritual nature (sensi   spirituali).\n\n Based on this and other passages, Judah argues that it is primarily by means of the beauty of created things that the individual is able to apprehend and move towards incorporeal or spiritual Beauty. Love is what is ultimately responsible for directing the soul and the intellect of the individual to increasingly spiritual matters.']";"Ah, that's a great question. I think that's where the idea of ""beauty"" gets expanded. In this sense, beauty isn't just about aesthetic qualities like harmony or proportion. It's also about the underlying order and coherence of the universe. So, for example, a mathematical proof can be seen as beautiful because of its elegance and simplicity, even if it's not conventionally beautiful. Our love for these abstract concepts is what allows us to appreciate their beauty, even if it's not immediately apparent. To put it another way, beauty is what shines through when we experience order, coherence, and unity – whether it's in a work of art, a mathematical proof, or a scientific concept.";That makes sense. But what about things that aren't necessarily beautiful, like a mathematical proof or a scientific concept? Can we still experience love for those things, even if they're not conventionally beautiful?
"['\n\n In the thought of Judah Abrabanel, the concepts of beauty (bellezza) and love (amore) become technical terms through which he examines virtually every traditional philosophical issue. Frequently, however, his discussion of one of these terms is predicated on the existence of the other; as a result, beauty and love are inseparable in the Dialoghi, undoubtedly mirroring Judah’s understanding of the way in which these two principles operate in the universe. The intimate relationship between these two principles may be witnessed in his definition of beauty as that “which delights the mind that recognizes it and moves it to love” (dilettando l’animo col suo conoscimento, il muove ad   amare).  Without Beauty, in other words, the intellect is unable to desire something outside of itself and, thus, it is effectively unable to cognize. Judah subsequently argues that the lower senses (i.e., taste, smell or touch) cannot grasp Beauty; only the higher senses (e.g., sight and hearing) can—in addition, of course, to the imagination and the  intellect.

Love is what is ultimately responsible for directing the soul and the intellect of the individual to increasingly spiritual matters.']";That's right. And it's not just a simple matter of cause and effect. It's more like a dynamic interplay between beauty and love. Our love for something can actually bring its beauty into being, at least in our subjective experience. To use a more poetic metaphor, love is like the light that illuminates beauty, allowing us to see it in all its glory.;I see what you mean. So love is what helps us see the beauty in things, even if they're not conventionally beautiful.

I'd argue that in most cases, beauty is indeed a means to an end. When we experience beauty, it often points us towards something greater than ourselves, whether it's an abstract concept, a higher power, or a deeper truth. But at the same time, there is definitely something to be said for appreciating beauty for its own sake. Can we really separate the two – meaning, can we truly appreciate beauty without loving it, or is that just a hypothetical scenario?;That makes sense. But is this idea of beauty as a means to an end still true, or can beauty be an end in itself? I mean, can we just appreciate beauty for its own sake, without necessarily loving it?

And that's precisely what Judah Abrabanel argues: that beauty and love are inseparable, and that they both point us towards the spiritual and the intangible. In his view, beauty is what shines forth when we experience the harmony and coherence of the universe – and love is what allows us to respond to it, to cognize it, and to be moved by it.;That's true, I guess. I mean, when I experience something beautiful, I do feel like it's taking me somewhere, whether it's to a new idea or just a new perspective.

Such antagonism reflects the broader context of the Maimonidean controversies, in which philosophers sought to make philosophy known to a broader Jewish public often by means of dramatic dialogues or philosophical novels.

Abrabanel’s emphasis, like that of many of his Renaissance contemporaries, on aesthetics and the phenomenal world would eventually become an important dimension of 16th- and 17th -century natural philosophy. We do know, for example, that Baruch Spinoza had a copy of the Dialoghi in his library.'];That's an excellent question. I'd like to use an analogy to help us understand this. Think of a master painter working on a new piece. They may have a vision of what they want to create, but the precise execution – the brushstrokes, colors, and textures – is an expression of their love for the art form. The beauty that emerges is not just from the technical skill, but also from the love and passion the artist pours into it. In this sense, you can say that the art, which represents the world, is infused with the artist's love and beauty. Now, apply this idea to a philosophical system, and the concept of grace enters as the natural, almost miraculous, unfolding of the world according to its inherent principles of love and beauty. This convergence of love, beauty, and the world's creation is exactly what Judah Abrabanel explores in his work, Dialoghi.;Professor Phil, I've been reading about the role of grace in different cultures and philosophies. How do you think the concept of grace interacts with ideas of love and beauty in a given philosophical system?

Consider the case of Aristotelianism in the Middle Ages. Some critics feared that philosophers were weakening people's commitment to traditional Jewish law, or halakhah. However, others believed that using rational, philosophical means to explain and relate their ideas could actually deepen understanding and adherence to their faith. It's a tricky balance, isn't it? Think of it like plant grafting. A philosophical system might incorporate diverse ideas and express them in a more inviting way, but one risks the possibility that the primary principles might get the ""graft"" they receive confused for the original plant. In contrast, well-performed grafting can help the overall plant thrive.";That makes sense. I've noticed some thinkers criticize philosophers who try to make their ideas more accessible to the general public. Do you think making philosophy more widely available would necessarily lead to its dilution or even undermine faith in a particular set of principles?

When we go back to the role of love and beauty in philosophical systems, you'd notice thinkers like Judah Abrabanel – not to mention Baruch Spinoza later on – try to integrate rationality, aesthetics, and spirituality. Their method was not just to 'terrify people into the faith,' so to speak, but to instead let the philosophical journey – and its inquiry into the actual nature of love, beauty, and human understanding – guide people deeper into the faith. In the context of Abrabanel's work, critics may have thought he relied too heavily on the rational understanding and perhaps went too far with it, which obscured what his goals actually were.;I see what you mean. It seemed like some critics blamed particular philosophical works for weakening faith, but also didn't other critics praise the use of rationality to deepen understanding?
['The abstract/concrete distinction has a curious status in contemporary philosophy. It is widely agreed that the ontological distinction is of fundamental importance, but as yet, there is no standard account of how it should be drawn. There is a consensus about how to classify certain paradigm cases. For example, it is usually acknowledged that numbers and the other objects of pure mathematics, like pure sets, are abstract (if they exist), whereas rocks, trees, and human beings are concrete. In everyday language, it is common to use expressions that refer to concrete entities as well as those that apparently refer to abstractions such as democracy, happiness, motherhood, etc. Moreover, formulations of mathematical theories seem to appeal directly to abstract entities, and the use of mathematical expressions in the empirical sciences seems indispensable to the formulation of our best empirical theories .  Finally, apparent reference to abstract entities such as sets, properties, concepts, propositions, types, and possible worlds, among others, is ubiquitous in different areas of philosophy.\n Though there is a pervasive appeal to abstract objects, philosophers have nevertheless wondered whether they exist. The alternatives are: platonism, which endorses their existence, and nominalism, which denies the existence of abstract objects across the board. (See the entries on  nominalism in metaphysics  and  platonism in metaphysics.)  But the question of how to draw the distinction between abstract and concrete objects is an open one: it is not clear how one should characterize these two categories nor is there a definite list of items that fall under one or the other category (assuming neither is empty).\n The first challenge, then, is to articulate the distinction, either by defining the terms explicitly or by embedding them in a theory that makes their connections to other important categories more explicit. In the absence of such an account, the philosophical significance of the contrast remains uncertain, for the attempt to classify things as abstract or concrete by appeal to intuition is often problematic. Is it clear that scientific theories (e.g., the general theory of relativity), works of fiction (e.g., Dante’s Inferno), fictional characters (e.g., Bilbo Baggins) or conventional entities  are abstract?\n It should be stressed that there may not be one single “correct” way of explaining the abstract/concrete distinction. Any plausible account will classify the paradigm cases in the standard way or give reasons for proceeding otherwise, and any interesting account will draw a clear and philosophically significant line in the domain of objects. Yet there may be many equally interesting ways of accomplishing these two goals, and if we find ourselves with two or more accounts that do the job rather well, there may be no point in asking which corresponds to the real abstract/concrete distinction. This illustrates a general point: when technical terminology is introduced in philosophy by means of examples, but without explicit definition or theoretical elaboration, the resulting vocabulary is often vague or indeterminate in reference. In such cases, it usually is pointless to seek a single correct account. A philosopher may find herself asking questions like, ‘What is idealism?’ or ‘What is a substance?’ and treating these questions as difficult questions about the underlying nature of a certain determinate philosophical category. A better approach may be to recognize that in many cases of this sort, we simply have not made up our minds about how the term is to be understood, and that what we seek is not a precise account of what this term already means, but rather a proposal for how it might fruitfully be used for philosophical analysis.

You see, this touches on the concept of abstract vs concrete objects. Think of it like a library. Concrete objects are like books on a shelf, tangible and directly accessible. Abstract objects, like numbers, are more like the cataloging system used to organize the books. They don't exist as physical objects, but they have a structure and rules that govern how they relate to each other.;Professor Phil, I've been thinking about numbers. Can numbers be considered objects?

Platonism posits that abstract objects, including numbers, have an objective existence independent of human thought. It's an old idea, tracing back to Plato himself. Think of it this way: even if humans didn't exist to think about numbers, the mathematical relationships and structures would still hold. This perspective argues that these abstract entities are not just human constructs, but realities themselves.;So, platonism is saying that numbers are like this separate realm of existence? That sounds a bit like fantasy.

Philosophers have been grappling with precisely defining these terms for ages. One way to look at it is through the lens of spatiality and temporality. Concrete objects typically exist in a specific time and place, whereas abstract objects do not. However, this is not a hard and fast rule, and there are plenty of counterarguments and edge cases that make drawing a clear distinction tricky.;But how do we even define abstract and concrete in the first place?

A novel, for instance, exists as a physical book, but the story, characters, and themes are abstract. Or take a song. The physical recording is concrete, but the music itself, the melody and harmony, are abstract. These examples highlight how blurry the lines between abstract and concrete can be, and how difficult it is to come up with a definition that covers all cases.;Like what?

Philosophically, what matters is not necessarily pinpointing a clear distinction, but understanding the implications of treating certain entities as abstract or concrete. It's about recognizing the utility and significance of these concepts in how we understand and interact with the world.;And does it matter if we can't define it perfectly?
['\n Frege famously distinguished two mutually exclusive ontological domains, functions and objects. According to his view, a function is an ‘incomplete’ entity that maps arguments to values, and is denoted by an incomplete expression, whereas an object is a ‘complete’ entity and can be denoted by a singular term. Frege reduced properties and relations to functions and so these entities are not included among the objects. Some authors make use of Frege’s notion of ‘object’ when discussing abstract objects . But though Frege’s sense of ‘object’ is important, it is not the only way to use the term. Other philosophers include properties and relations among the abstract objects. And when the background context for discussing objects is type theory, properties and relations of higher type (e.g., properties of properties, and properties of relations) may be all be considered ‘objects’. This latter use of ‘object’ is interchangeable with  ‘entity.’  Throughout this entry, we will follow this last usage and treat the expressions ‘object’ and ‘entity’ as having the same meaning. (For further discussion, see the entry on  objects.)'];That's a good starting point. Think of abstract objects like a map. Just as a map represents a territory but isn't the territory itself, abstract objects like numbers and ideas represent concepts, but they aren't tangible. However, that doesn't necessarily mean they don't exist. After all, we can use maps to navigate the real world. Similarly, we can use abstract objects to understand and describe the world.;Professor, I've been thinking about this concept of abstract objects. Are they just things that don't exist in the real world, like numbers and ideas?

In fact, some philosophers, like Frege, would argue that properties and relations are more like functions, which are incomplete by themselves and only make sense when applied to objects. But others might say that these functions are indeed a type of abstract object, albeit one that's different from numbers and ideas.;But aren't some things, like properties and relations, more like actions or ways things interact? How do they fit into this idea of abstract objects?

In type theory, these functions can be treated as objects, just like numbers or ideas, but with different properties and relations. For instance, a property of a property can be seen as a higher-order function, which is still an abstract object, but one that operates on other abstract objects. Think of it like Russian nesting dolls – each one can be considered a complete entity, but they also contain other entities within them.;So, it's like... if we have a function that describes a shape, it's not just an action, but an actual thing that has properties, like the shape being circular or triangular?

The concept of abstract objects is not a fixed entity, but rather a way of thinking about the world that depends on the context and the theories we use to describe it. And that's what makes philosophy so rich and fascinating – the boundaries between objects, functions, and relations can be blurry, but exploring those boundaries helps us understand the world in a deeper way.;I see. So, it's all about how we define what an object is and how we use that definition to understand the world.

To explore this, let's use the analogy of a map. Just as a map represents a physical territory but isn't the territory itself, we could say that numbers represent quantities or patterns in the world, but are they the actual quantities or just the conceptual tools we use to understand and describe them? Think about it.;Professor Phil, I've been thinking, are numbers real?

However, consider this counterargument: even if we didn't exist to discover or describe the number 1, would it still 'exist' in the same way a rock or a tree does? Or is it more akin to a concept, such as justice or beauty, which rely on our understanding and description to have any meaning?;That makes sense, but what about the number 1? Doesn't it have an existence of its own, even if we didn't discover it?

One way to think about this is to consider the distinction between objects that occupy space and time, and those that don't. Chairs, being physical objects, take up space and change over time, whereas numbers, like the number 1, seem to exist independently of space and time. But is this distinction always clear-cut? What about things like shadows or holes? Do they exist in the physical world, or are they more abstract?;I see your point, but how do we differentiate between things like numbers and, say, chairs? Why do we say chairs exist in the physical world while numbers don't?

The abstract-concrete distinction is indeed multifaceted, and different philosophers have approached it from various angles. To add another layer to the discussion, consider this idea: some philosophers see the distinction not as between abstract and concrete objects, but as between abstract objects and ordinary objects, with the difference being a matter of modality – i.e., ordinary objects can exist in different ways or in different worlds, whereas abstract objects are seen as fixed or necessary. While we won't explore this idea in depth today, keep in mind that the debate is ongoing, and there's no one 'right' answer to these questions.;That's a really interesting perspective. It makes me think about how we categorize things in general. I never realized how complex the abstract-concrete distinction is.

These include: the way of example (which is simply to list the paradigm cases of abstract and concrete objects in the hope that the sense of the distinction will somehow emerge); the way of conflation (i.e., identifying abstract and concrete objects with some already-known distinction); the way of negation (i.e., saying what abstract objects are by saying what they are not, e.g., non-spatiotemporal, non-causal, etc.); and the way of abstraction (i.e., saying that abstract objects are conceptualized by a process of considering some known objects and omitting certain distinguishing features).

Imagine taking a concrete object and gradually stripping away its distinguishing features - its shape, color, size. At what point does it become an abstract object? This process-oriented approach can help us understand the distinction, but it's still tricky to pin down exactly when the transformation occurs. It's like trying to define the moment when a caterpillar becomes a butterfly - it's a gradual process, and the exact point of transformation is hard to identify.";Those approaches all seem limited. Is there another way to think about this?

Even if we can't find a single, accepted account of the abstract/concrete distinction, these various methods can still provide explanatory power when combined with other theoretical frameworks. By acknowledging the limitations of each approach, we can develop a more comprehensive understanding of the issues at play. It's like constructing a mosaic - each tile, on its own, might not provide a complete picture, but together, they can create a beautiful and complex work of art.;It seems like all these approaches have their strengths and weaknesses. But what if we combine them, or use them in conjunction with other theories?
['\n According to the way of example, it suffices to list paradigm cases of abstract and concrete entities in the hope that the sense of the distinction will somehow emerge. Clearly, a list of examples for each category would be a heuristically promising start in the search for some criterion (or list of criteria) that would be fruitful for drawing the distinction. However, a simple list would be of limited significance since there are too many ways of extrapolating from the paradigm cases to a distinction that would cover the unclear cases, with the result that no clear notion has been explained.\n For example, pure sets are paradigm examples of abstract entities. But the case of impure sets is far from clear. Consider the unit set whose sole member is Joe Biden (i.e., {Joe Biden}), the Undergraduate Class of 2020 or The Ethics Committee, etc. They are sets, but it is not clear that they are abstract given that Joe Biden, the members of the class and committee are concrete. Similarly, if one offers the characters of Sherlock Holmes stories as examples to help motivate the primitive concept abstract object, then one has to wonder about the object London that appears in the novels.\n The refusal to characterize the abstract/concrete distinction while maintaining that both categories have instances might be called the way of primitivism, whenever the following condition obtains: a few predicates are distinguished as primitive and unanalyzable, and the explanatory power rests on the fact that other interesting predicates can be defined in terms of the primitives and that interesting claims can be judged true on the basis of our intuitive understanding of the primitive and defined notions.

For example, when mathematicians take set and membership as primitives and then assert some principles of set theory, they often illustrate their primitives by offering some examples of sets, such as The Undergraduate Class of 2020 or The Ethics Committee, etc. But these, of course, aren’t quite right, since the members of the class and committee may change while the class and committee remain the same, whereas if the members of a set change, one has a different set. A similar concern affects the present proposal. If one offers sets or the characters of the Sherlock Holmes novels as examples to help motivate the primitive concept abstract object, then one has to wonder about impure sets such as the unit set whose sole member is Aristotle (i.e., \\(\\{\\textrm{Aristotle}\\}\\)) and the object London that appears in the novels.'];"That's a question that has puzzled philosophers for a long time.

That's where things get murky. You see, sets are often considered abstract because their existence isn't tied to specific spatial or temporal locations. However, when we have impure sets, like the one containing Joe Biden, it becomes unclear whether the set itself is abstract or concrete. We might say that the set is abstract, but its member is concrete, which raises interesting questions about the relationship between abstract and concrete entities.;That brings me to sets - are they always abstract? I mean, if a set contains concrete objects, does that make it concrete too?

For one, it's not always easy to come up with intuitive instances of these primitive notions. Moreover, even if we do, we risk running into problems similar to the one we encountered with impure sets. For example, if we take sets as primitive and use them to illustrate abstract entities, we might struggle to account for impure sets that seem to blur the line between abstract and concrete.;But isn't that just a problem with our definitions? If we can't define abstract and concrete entities clearly, can't we just take them as primitive notions and work from there?
"['\n Another methodology is what Lewis calls the way of abstraction. According to a longstanding tradition in philosophical psychology, abstraction is a distinctive mental process in which new ideas or conceptions are formed by considering the common features of several objects or ideas and ignoring the irrelevant features that distinguish those objects. For example, if one is given a range of white things of varying shapes and sizes; one ignores or abstracts from the respects in which they differ, and thereby attains the abstract idea of whiteness. Nothing in this tradition requires that ideas formed in this way represent or correspond to a distinctive kind of object. But it might be maintained that the distinction between abstract and concrete objects should be explained by reference to the psychological process of abstraction or something like it. The simplest version of this strategy would be to say that an object is abstract if it is (or might be) the referent of an abstract idea; i.e., an idea formed by abstraction. So conceived, the way of abstraction is wedded to an outmoded philosophy of mind.\n It should be mentioned, though, that the key idea behind the way of abstraction has resurfaced (though transformed) in the structuralist views about mathematics that trace back to Dedekind. Dedekind thought of numbers by the way of abstraction. Dedekind suggested that when defining a number-theoretic structure, “we entirely neglect the special character of the elements, merely retaining their distinguishability and taking into account only the relations to one another” . This view has led some structuralists to deny that numbers are abstract objects. For example, Benacerraf concluded that “numbers are not objects at all, because in giving the properties (that is, necessary and sufficient) of numbers you merely characterize an abstract structure—and the distinction lies in the fact that the ‘elements’ of the structure have no properties other than those relating them to other ‘elements’ of the same structure” . We shall therefore turn our attention to a variant of the way of abstraction, one that has led a number of philosophers to conclude that numbers are indeed abstract objects.']";That's an interesting question. To address it, let's consider an analogy. Think of numbers like a map. Is the map a discovery or a creation? A map is created to represent the layout of the land, but the land itself existed before the map. Similarly, numbers can be seen as a tool we create to represent quantities and relationships. However, the question remains whether those quantities and relationships exist independently of our creation.;Professor Phil, I've been thinking a lot about numbers and how we perceive them. Can you tell me, are numbers discovered or created?

One way to approach this is by thinking about abstraction. Imagine you're looking at a group of different objects, all of which are white but vary in shape and size. If you ignore their differences and focus on their shared whiteness, you're forming an abstract idea. Some philosophers argue that numbers can be understood in this way, as abstract ideas formed by considering the common features of various quantities. But this raises the question of whether such abstraction gives rise to a distinct, abstract realm.;I see what you mean. But what about the idea that numbers have an abstract existence? Maybe they exist in some realm beyond our physical reality.

This view has led some to argue that numbers aren't objects at all, but rather a way of describing relationships within a structure.;That makes sense.

Abstract objects like ""beauty"" or ""friendship"" can be thought of as existing in an abstract space, even though they manifest in the world in countless, diverse ways. Philosophers like Zalta have developed complex theories to understand these higher-order abstract objects and how they interact. The question then becomes: Are these merely our ways of grouping similar phenomena or do they have a reality that transcends our perceptions?";Hmm, I can see both sides. But what about other areas beyond mathematics? Do abstract objects play a role there too?

Philosophers like Putnam argue for the existence of abstract objects based on their role in scientific theories, suggesting that their existence is as real as the entities postulated by physics. In linguistics, theories about abstract objects help us understand how we structure and refer to concepts. Even in computer science, abstract representations are crucial for designing algorithms and programs. So, the debate over abstract objects is not just a theoretical curiosity but has practical implications for how we understand the world and our place in it.;That sounds like a very ongoing discussion. How do people in other fields see this? Does anyone actually apply these concepts?

It touches upon fundamental questions of existence, knowledge, and the human experience. By exploring the nature of abstract objects, philosophers are also debating the limits of human understanding and the relationship between mind and reality. It's a rich, challenging field that keeps philosophers thinking critically about the world.;Wow, I had no idea it was so widespread. It seems like a very central debate in philosophy.
"['\n In §3, we passed over without comment the parenthetical phrase from Quine’s characterization of essentialism.

Since it is necessary that seven plus two is greater than seven, when the number nine is referred to as ‘seven plus two’ it is essentially greater than seven. But, since it is not necessary that the number of planets is greater than seven, when the number nine is referred to as ‘the number of planets’ it is not essentially greater than seven.

Similarly, an anti-essentialist might say that when a person who is both a mathematician and a cyclist is thought of as a mathematician, being rational is essential to him, while being two-legged is not; but when the very same person is thought of as a cyclist, then although being two-legged is essential to him, being rational is not. Again, the point is supposed to be that it makes no sense to say of the very person who is the mathematical cyclist, independently of any way of thinking about him, that he is or is not essentially rational (or two-legged). According to the anti-essentialist, asking whether Andrew Wiles (who we may suppose is a cycling mathematician) could fail to be rational is like asking whether Andrew Wiles is taller than—both questions demand another relatum. Could he fail to be rational, relative to what way of referring to him? Is he taller than whom?\n In response the essentialist will point out that the anti-essentialist’s thought does not square very well with intuition. Consider the object that is referred to by all these phrases: ‘nine’, ‘seven plus two’, ‘the number of planets’. Could that very object have failed to be greater than seven?

According to intuition then, the very object that is referred to by ‘the number of planets’ (which is the very same object that is referred to by ‘seven plus two’ and ‘nine’) is essentially greater than seven.

I'll use an analogy to clarify this: think of a person's essential properties as a set of underlying musical notes, while how they're referred to is like different songs that use those same notes. The question then becomes, can we consider the underlying music without thinking about the specific song that's being played? Intuitively, it seems like the answer should be yes.;Professor Phil, I've been thinking a lot about identity and essential properties. Do you think it's possible to talk about someone's essential properties without considering how they're referred to?

They'd say that what's essential to someone or something depends on how we're thinking about them. But essentialists would counter that just because our way of thinking about something changes, it doesn't mean that the thing itself has changed. To use the music analogy again, just because we're playing a different song using the same notes, it doesn't mean that the notes themselves have changed. Consider the number nine: whether we refer to it as 'seven plus two' or 'the number of planets', it still has the same underlying properties.;But what if the way they're referred to actually changes their essential properties? For example, if I'm a mathematician, being rational might be essential to me, but if I'm a cyclist, it's not.

Intuition suggests that it's the latter. According to the essentialist, our intuition is correct, and that's what grounds our talk of essential properties independently of how they're referred to.;That makes sense, I think.

['\n Assuming that we have knowledge of some essentialist claims, how might we account for that knowledge?

However our a priori knowledge that every organism has its origin essentially does seem to have special problems over and above the problems associated with accounting for our a priori knowledge of logic, mathematics, and the homelier necessary truths. The latter claims are generally supported by universally held intuitions or by arguments that are universally accepted whereas the former, like most philosophical claims, is supported by a less robust intuition and by a more controversial argument.

Imagine you're a master chef, and you're trying to identify the ingredients in a cake just by tasting it. You can't see the ingredients, but you can infer their presence based on the flavor, texture, and other properties of the cake. Similarly, essentialism suggests that we can know certain properties of a person or object that are essential to their identity, even if we can't directly observe them. But how we arrive at that knowledge is a more complex question.;Professor Phil, I've been thinking about this concept of essentialism. Is it possible for us to know something that is essential to a person or object without directly observing it?

To illustrate this, think of a math problem. You might use logical reasoning to derive the solution, but you also need to understand the definitions and axioms that underlie the math. In the case of essentialism, we use a priori knowledge to understand concepts like origin and kind, and then combine that with empirical knowledge about the person or object in question. For example, we might use our a priori knowledge that every organism has its origin essentially, and then empirically verify that Socrates originated from sperm s and egg e.;That makes sense. But how do we actually know that something is essential to a person or object? Is it just based on intuition or is there a more rational process involved?

While some essentialist claims, like the necessity of logical truths, are widely accepted, others, like origin essentialism, are more contentious. In those cases, the a priori knowledge may be based on less robust intuitions and more controversial arguments. Think of it like building a tower of blocks. The lower blocks represent more widely accepted truths, while the higher blocks represent more speculative claims that are subject to greater debate. To justify our a priori knowledge of origin essentialism, we would need to provide additional arguments and evidence to support it.;I see what you mean. But how do we account for the a priori knowledge itself? Is it just based on universally accepted intuitions or is there a more objective basis?
"['\n Leibniz’s Law of the Indiscernibility of Identicals, according to which, if “two” things are identical, then they share all their properties, can be used to argue for various claims of nonidentity. If you know, for example, that Charles is a philosophy major and that Yoko is not, then you can safely infer that Charles is not identical to Yoko. Essentialist claims have played a role in some prominent Leibniz Law arguments for nonidentity theses. A certain brand of mind-body dualism may be argued for in the following way: \\(X\\) is essentially a thinking thing; \\(X\\)’s body is not essentially a thinking thing; so \\(X\\) is not (identical to) \\(X\\)’s body. A similar argument can be given for the conclusion that a statue is not identical with the lump of material (wax, clay, marble, or what have you) that constitutes it. Consider a human-shaped statue—call it ‘Goliath’—and the lump of wax that composes it—call it ‘Lump\\(_1\\)’. Goliath, we may imagine, is throughout its entire existence composed of Lump\\(_1\\) while Lump\\(_1\\) throughout its entire existence composes Goliath. In this case, Goliath and Lump\\(_1\\) are spatiotemporally colocated, which is just to say that they occupy the exact same spatial region at any given time whenever either of them exists. This being the case, they share most of their properties: Goliath weighs 17 kilograms and so does Lump\\(_1\\); Goliath has a white surface and so does Lump\\(_1\\); and so on. In fact, it may seem curious that we are writing as though there are two things at all. Why not say simply that Goliath and Lump\\(_1\\) are identical? Well, it at least seems that a pretty straightforward argument—one that relies on essentialist claims—establishes their nonidentity:\n The plausibility of the two premises seems undeniable, given that we think, for example, that if the room containing Goliath/Lump\\(_1\\) were to get really hot (hot enough to melt the wax) and then to cool again (so that what was left was a lump of wax in the shape of something like a mountain), then Goliath would be destroyed while Lump\\(_1\\) would still exist. And the reasoning looks impeccable: if Goliath were Lump\\(_1\\), then each would have to have all of the same properties as “the other”; since they have different properties, they must not be identical. (Few things in philosophy are as uncontroversial as Leibniz’s Law of the Indiscernibility of Identicals, though there has been some dispute about the proper way of formulating it.) Figuring out how to reconcile our intuitions that (1) and (2) are true with our tendency to think that Goliath and Lump\\(_1\\) are not really two things but just one is a version of the problem of material constitution. There are a wide variety of ways to deal with this problem. A “two-thinger”—one who thinks that there really are two things, a statue and a lump of wax, in one location—may simply eschew the tendency to identify Goliath and Lump\\(_1\\). Other responses suggest that there is something amiss with Leibniz Law arguments for nonidentities when there is this kind of an appeal to essential properties: Della Rocca  holds that such arguments are question begging; Lewis  and Noonan  hold that they are invalid; and Burke  and Rea  hold that in any such argument, at least one of the premises is false. For those who are interested, Rea  is a good place to start to delve more deeply into this problem.']";That's a fantastic question. Think of it like a recipe for your favorite cake. If someone else follows the exact same recipe and makes the same cake, is it the same cake? No, it's a different cake, even though they have the same properties, like taste and ingredients. This is because they're separate entities in the world, even if they share similarities. Similarly, when we consider identity, we must take into account more than just the characteristics something has – we need to consider what makes it that particular thing, aside from just its properties.;Professor Phil, I was thinking about identity and how we define one thing as the same or different from another. What makes a thing what it is?

And now think about it the other way around: what if I had a big chunk of wax, and I chose to shape it like my face? I could say, ""Ah, this is Phil Wax,"" but then, if I melted the wax, would Phil Wax still exist? Most people would say no, the identity we gave the wax – Phil Wax – didn't survive after it melted. But the wax itself, its material substance, did. This shows that there's a difference between the thing itself (the wax) and the identity we attribute to it (Phil Wax).";So it's like the cake's identity is tied to its existence or its being in the world, regardless of what it looks or tastes like?
"['\n Leibniz’s Law of the Indiscernibility of Identicals, according to which, if “two” things are identical, then they share all their properties, can be used to argue for various claims of nonidentity.

But what's interesting is when things have conflicting properties – like the wax having the potential to be both Phil Wax and just a lump of wax after melting. If we believe, like many people do, that something can't be ""destroyed"" just by changing shape, then maybe the wax has a more fundamental identity than the one we give it (Phil Wax). But this creates tension between the thing itself (the wax), and the identity that comes with it having a certain form (the shaped wax, or Phil Wax). That's where philosophers like Leibniz and others have argued that we can't reduce identity down to just a thing's characteristics, because sometimes those characteristics can contradict each other, or even change.";That's a confusing example, but also kind of cool. So, that means that we kind of give things an identity? It sounds arbitrary?

They think that, yes, Goliath the statue and the lump of wax that makes it up are both real things, but they're different – they just happen to exist in the same place, and sometimes we use the same name (Goliath) to refer to both. While others argue that these identities aren't mutually exclusive – that a lump of wax can indeed be a statue at the same time, because something's properties (like being wax) can coexist with something's form (being Goliath) and shape (the statue).;And if that's the case, does that mean we should think that things can have multiple identities?

Think of our arm moving versus us raising our arm as the difference between a thrown stone versus a painter tossing a brush stroke onto a canvas. Both involve objects in motion, but one is guided by our intentions, while the other isn't. In the case of the brush stroke, the painter's movement isn't just an automatic response – they're using the motion to achieve a specific artistic effect. Our arm raising can be seen in a similar light; we're intentionally moving our arm to accomplish something.";Professor Phil, I've been reading some philosophy of action lately, and I'm having trouble understanding why our arm moving versus us raising our arm are different actions.

Let's play devil's advocate for a moment. Suppose someone tickles you while you're asleep, and your arm moves involuntarily. You have no conscious intention to move your arm, but some might argue that there's still an underlying neural process or 'desire' at play. Does that count as an intention? To complicate matters further, some philosophers argue that focusing on internal mental states, like desires or intentions, isn't the best way to understand actions. They propose looking at the external, observable aspects of intentional behavior instead. Others have even suggested that actions should be understood as part of a larger narrative or context, rather than just individual events.;That makes sense, I think. But how do we determine what intention is? Is it just our desire to accomplish something?

So, do you think Wittgenstein's question still has value for philosophers of action today?
['\n Possibly the most widespread and accepted theory of intentional action (though by no means without its challengers) is the causal theory of action, a theory according to which something counts as an intentional action in virtue of its causal connection to certain mental states. In fact, this view is often dubbed  the ‘standard story of action’. Although other philosophers proposed similar views before, the contemporary causal theory of action, or “causalism,” was pioneered by Donald Davidson, especially the essays collected in Davidson . Davidson has contributed to many topics in the philosophy of action, such as action individuation, the logical form of action sentences, the relation between intention and evaluative judgments, among others, but here we will focus mostly on his arguments for, and his formulation of, the causal theory of action. In Action, Reasons, and Causes (ARC), Davidson provides an account of the nature of rationalizing explanations of actions, or what is often called ‘intentional explanations’. Such explanations explain the action by providing the reason why the agent acted. ARC tries to understand how a reason can explain an action. The two central theses of ARC, or modified versions of them, became subsequently widely, though certainly not universally, accepted. The first thesis is that the explanation of an action involves a “primary reason”: a belief and a desire pair that rationalizes the action by expressing the end pursued in the action (desire) and how the agent thought the action would accomplish this end (instrumental belief). So, for instance, in “Larry went to Gus the Barber because he wanted a haircut”, Larry’s action is explained by a desire (his wanting a haircut) and a belief, left implicit in this case (his believing that he could get a haircut by going to Gus the Barber). The second central thesis is that the primary reason is also the cause of the action.'];That's a great question. To break it down, consider this analogy: imagine you're driving a car. You're heading towards a destination, but there are many factors influencing your journey – the road signs, other drivers, even the GPS. Now, you might ask, 'Am I really in control, or am I just following the path set before me?' This is similar to the debate surrounding intentional action. One dominant theory, which we can call the 'standard story,' posits that our actions are the result of a causal connection to our mental states – our desires, beliefs, and intentions. In other words, your decision to come to this university might be seen as the result of a desire for a good education and a belief that this university would provide that.;Professor Phil, I'm thinking about why I decided to come to this university. Was it really my choice, or was I just influenced by all the people around me?

Some philosophers argue that our desires and beliefs might not be the true causes of our actions. Perhaps our environment and past experiences have shaped our desires in ways we're not even aware of. This brings us to the concept of primary reasons. A primary reason is a combination of a desire and a belief that explains why we acted in a certain way. In your coffee example, your primary reason might be a desire for a stimulating drink and a belief that coffee would satisfy that desire. But, as you pointed out, we might also question whether these desires and beliefs are truly our own or if they're influenced by external factors.;But what about when I decide to grab a coffee? Is that really my desire, or am I just conditioned to want coffee after a long night of studying?

Some argue that if our actions are the result of causal connections to our mental states, which are themselves shaped by factors outside our control, then we're not truly free. However, proponents of the standard story would argue that this doesn't necessarily lead to determinism. As Davidson's work suggests, our reasons for acting – our desires and beliefs – can still be seen as the causes of our actions, even if those reasons are influenced by external factors. So, while our choices might not be completely free from external influences, we can still consider them intentional actions.;I see what you mean. But doesn't that lead to a kind of determinism, where our choices aren't really our own?
"['\n Davidson’s view in ARC is presented against a number of philosophers (mostly influenced by Wittgenstein), who, on his view, take action explanations to provide a different kind of understanding than causal explanations . Some of the identified targets of the paper  are clearly arguing for the views Davidson rejects. Others  do not clearly embrace the theses Davidson objects to, or at least not all of them. These philosophers took intentional explanations to display how an action is made intelligible or justified. So Melden says that “citing a motive  a fuller characterization of the action; it  a better understanding of what the  is doing” . Similarly, Anscombe’s special sense of the question “Why?’, discussed below (section 4.1), is supposed to pick out the particular way in which actions are explained. This claim is not one that Davidson denies; according to Davidson, in intentional explanations, or ‘rationalizations’, ”the agent is shown in his Role of Rational Animal … There is an irreducible … sense in which every rationalization justifies: from the agent’s point of view there was, when he acted, something to be said for the action.“ . But Melden, and other Wittgensteineans, argue that this kind of explanation cannot be a causal explanation. Melden’s central argument is the ”logical connection“ argument. According to Melden, since the supposedly causal antecedents of an action (mental items such as desires and intentions) are logically related to the intentional action (I would not count as intentionally signalling a turn if I did not desire/intend to signal a turn), the explanation of the action in terms of such mental items cannot be an explanation in terms of ”Humean causes“. After all, Humean causation connects events that are logically independent.\n Davidson’s ARC exposes a crucial fallacy with Melden’s argument (similar problems had been pointed out by Annette Baier (then Annette Stoop) in Stoop 1962). Accepting Hume’s account of causal relations does not commit us to the view that any description of a cause is logically independent of any description of its effect. An event can only be described as ”sunburning“ if it is caused by exposure to the sun, but this does not mean that the cause of a sunburn is not a ”separate entity“ from the sunburn. We can describe an event as ”The event that caused X“ without thereby refuting Humeanism about causation. Davidson argues that, on the contrary, the mental items cited in an action explanation can only explain the action if they are also the cause of the action (the second central thesis of ARC). In our example above, Larry might have had other belief-desire pairs that rationalized his action of going to the barber. For instance, Larry might also have wanted a bottle of cream soda and believed that he could procure such an item at Gus the Barber. However, he did not (we may stipulate) go there because he wanted cream soda but because he wanted a haircut (and believed he could get one at Gus the Barber). The only way we can explain the difference between potentially rationalizing, but non-explanatory belief-desire pairs, is that the belief-desire pair that genuinely explains the action, the primary reason, also causes the action. The question of how non-causal theories can distinguish between merely potentially explanatory reasons for an action from the reasons that actually explain it became known as ”Davidson’s Challenge“ to non-causal theories of action .']";"Ah, that's an interesting question. Think of it like this: when you're driving a car and you turn the steering wheel to the left, we can explain that physically by the mechanics of the car and the laws of physics. However, if I ask you why you turned the wheel, and you say ""to turn left,"" that seems different. It's not just about physical causation, but about your intentions and reasons for doing so.";Professor, I've been thinking about how people explain their actions. Is saying someone did something because of a reason the same as saying something physically caused that action?

Some philosophers, like David Hume, argued that causation is all about separate events being connected – like billiard balls hitting each other. But with mental states and actions, it's harder to separate the cause from the effect. Your brain state might be connected to your intention in a way that isn't just physical causation.;But doesn't the reason why I turned the wheel have something to do with physical brain states or something? Maybe my brain sent a signal to my hand to move the wheel?

However, others, like Melden, would say that because there's a logical connection between your brain state and your intention, it's not a causal explanation in the same way. It's more like understanding why you did something in terms of your reasons and motivations. But, as Davidson would argue, that doesn't necessarily mean it's not a causal explanation.;I don't get it. If my brain state causes my hand to move, that sounds like regular causation to me. Why can't we just say that's the cause of my turning the wheel?

And that's where Davidson's argument comes in – that the mental items cited in an action explanation can only explain the action if they are also the cause of the action.;I think I see what you mean. So, the real question is not whether reasons can be causes, but how we can tell which reasons are the actual causes?
"['\n Although initially presented as an account of the nature of action explanation, Davidson’s account also contains the basic structure of an understanding of human action: according to Davidson, a true action statement (of the form ”x φ-ed“) denotes an event, and more specifically, a bodily movement. A bodily movement is an action if, and only if, the event is an intentional action . Davidson does not say this  explicitly,  but clearly on his view, an event is an intentional action under a certain description, if and only if, there is a true rationalizing explanation of the event under this description. Davidson  (following Anscombe) points out that ”x φ-ed intentionally“ creates an intensional context; that is whether an action is intentional depends on how the action is described. To use Davidson’s example, if I flip a switch, I also turn on the light, and alert the burglar. On Davidson’s view ”flipping the switch“, ”turning on the light“, and ”alerting the burglar“ are all descriptions of the same action. The ”accordion effect“ , characteristic of human action, makes it the case that the causal consequences of an intentional action provide further descriptions of human actions. If my flipping the switch caused the light to go on and the burglar to be alerted, then I also turned the light on and alerted the burglar. However, only the first two are intentional actions. On Davidson’s view, all these descriptions are descriptions of the same action; alerting the burglar is an action in virtue of the fact that these same bodily movements, under a different description, are a case of intentional action (flipping the switch). Thus Davidson concludes that, ”we never do more than move our bodies: the rest is up to nature“ . We can see now how the claims developed in these papers provide us with a theory of action: an action is a bodily movement such that, under some description, the bodily movement is causally explained by a primary reason.\n This also gives us the barebones of a causal theory of action: according to ”causalists“, intentional action is explained in terms of mental states that are the causal antecedents, or concomitants, of the agent’s behaviour or bodily movement. Subsequent to Davidson, causalists have aimed to provide reductive explanations: intentional action is identified with behaviour or bodily movement  whose causal antecedents (or concomitants) are certain specified mental states. Although Davidson himself is often portrayed as proposing a reductive analysis, he never presents any of his views as fulfilling such ambition and expresses skepticism that such analysis is possible given the problem of deviance (see below).']";That's an interesting question. Think of it like playing a musical instrument. When you're playing a chord on the guitar, you're not just intentionally pressing the strings with your fingers - you're also intentionally producing the sound that comes out of it. But are you really intentionally doing both things, or are you just doing one thing that has multiple effects? Maybe it's more like your body is doing one thing, and the consequences of that action are what produce the rest of the effects.;Professor Phil, I was thinking - can we ever really intend to do more than one thing at once?

And this is where the idea of 'intentional action under a certain description' comes in. Consider this example: if you're driving a car and turn the wheel to avoid a pedestrian, you're also intentionally turning the car in a certain direction, but you're not necessarily intentionally startling the pedestrian who's standing nearby. However, the act of turning the wheel, in a sense, encompasses all these different descriptions of what you're doing.;That makes sense, I think. So, you're saying that we can't really intend to do more than one thing, but our actions can still have multiple consequences.

And this 'spreading out' of consequences is what's often referred to as the 'accordion effect' in philosophy. It's the idea that the effects of our intentional actions can keep expanding, and that these effects can all be seen as part of the original action. However, not all these effects are intentional - some of them are just, as it were, along for the ride.;But that's weird, because it sounds like the consequences of our actions can kind of 'spread out' and encompass more and more things. Is that a good way to put it?

However, I'd say it's more about how we choose to describe our actions. We might say that you intentionally turned the wheel, but that the startling of the pedestrian was just an unforeseen consequence. The question then becomes: what makes an action intentional, as opposed to just being a consequence of that action? That's where the debate between 'causalists' and others comes in, with some arguing that intentional action can be explained solely in terms of mental states and their causal effects, while others, like Davidson, are more skeptical about the possibility of such a reduction.;So, does that mean we can never really be sure what all the consequences of our actions are going to be? And therefore, we can never really be sure what all we're intentionally doing?
"['\n The idea that an action is rationalized by its mental states is still very popular; much less so is the view that the only relevant states are beliefs and desires . As Bratman  argues, desires do not have the conduct-controlling and settling functions characteristic of intentions, and thus intentions seem to be better placed to be at the center of an account in which intentional actions are constituted by their causal genesis. My desire to have my teeth cleaned, when conjoined with my belief that in order to get my teeth cleaned I need to go to a dentist, will not result in my moving towards the dentist until I actually intend to go to the dentist. In fact, when Velleman comes to dub this kind of causal theory of action ”the standard story of action“, he explicitly describes the view as one in which intention plays a central role between the ”primary reason“ and the action. In the standard story, the agent’s ”desire for the end, and his belief in the action as a means … jointly cause an intention to take it, which in turn causes the corresponding movements of the agent’s body.“ . Davidson  himself came to accept that intentions play an important role in the causation and constitution of action and that intentions could not be reduced to beliefs or desires. But common to all these views is the idea that human actions are events that bear the right kind of causal relation to certain mental states or events of the agent that also explain the action.\n One alternative to the causal view understands agency as a form of irreducible agent-causation. Chisholm  presents a classic version of the view; Alvarez and Hyman  presents a radically different version which denies that agents cause the actions themselves; Mayr  develops a version of the view that, unlike Chisholm’s version, tries to show that human agency is not essentially different from other forms of substance causation that we find in the natural world. A second alternative sees intentional explanations as teleological rather than causal explanations ; that is, an intentional explanation cites the goal, the purpose, or the reason for which the agent acted rather than the antecedent causes of the action. Defenders of this view also try to provide an understanding of the teleological structure of intentional action that denies that teleological explanations reduce to causal explanations; they are instead a sui generis form of explanation. One way this view can meet Davidson’s Challenge is to argue that the truth of certain counterfactuals distinguishes potential reasons from the actual reasons. For instance, it could be true that even though the fact that the asparagus was delicious was a potential reason for Mary to eat asparagus, she would not have eaten them if they were not healthy and she would have eaten them even if they were not delicious ; such counterfactuals, on this view, are not grounded on causal relations between mental states and the bodily movements, but on the teleological structures that constitute intentional action. Finally, the causal account also contrasts with the neo-Aristotelian view in which human action is constituted, roughly, by a special form of practical knowledge ; on this view, in intentional action, ”knowledge is the  cause of what it understands“ (see section 4 of this entry).']";Not quite, my inquisitive student. While desires and beliefs do play a role in our decision-making, they aren't the entire story. Think of it like this: Imagine you're driving a car, and you want to get to your favorite restaurant. You believe that if you take a certain route, you'll get there. But, just having that desire and belief doesn't make the car move. You need to intend to drive to the restaurant, you need to make the conscious decision to put the car in gear and start moving. Intentions are what actually control and settle our actions. Desires and beliefs are just the precursors to those intentions.;Professor Phil, I was thinking about why people do the things they do, and I came up with this idea that basically, it's because of our desires and what we believe. If I want something, and I believe I can get it by doing something, then I'll do that thing. Is that right?

Davidson  himself came to accept that intentions play an important role in the causation and constitution of action and that intentions could not be reduced to beliefs or desires. But common to all these views is the idea that human actions are events that bear the right kind of causal relation to certain mental states or events of the agent that also explain the action.\n One alternative to the causal view understands agency as a form of irreducible agent-causation. Chisholm  presents a classic version of the view; Alvarez and Hyman  presents a radically different version which denies that agents cause the actions themselves; Mayr  develops a version of the view that, unlike Chisholm’s version, tries to show that human agency is not essentially different from other forms of substance causation that we find in the natural world. A second alternative sees intentional explanations as teleological rather than causal explanations ; that is, an intentional explanation cites the goal, the purpose, or the reason for which the agent acted rather than the antecedent causes of the action. Defenders of this view also try to provide an understanding of the teleological structure of intentional action that denies that teleological explanations reduce to causal explanations; they are instead a sui generis form of explanation. One way this view can meet Davidson’s Challenge is to argue that the truth of certain counterfactuals distinguishes potential reasons from the actual reasons. For instance, it could be true that even though the fact that the asparagus was delicious was a potential reason for Mary to eat asparagus, she would not have eaten them if they were not healthy and she would have eaten them even if they were not delicious ; such counterfactuals, on this view, are not grounded on causal relations between mental states and the bodily movements, but on the teleological structures that constitute intentional action. Finally, the causal account also contrasts with the neo-Aristotelian view in which human action is constituted, roughly, by a special form of practical knowledge ; on this view, in intentional action, ”knowledge is the  cause of what it understands“ (see section 4 of this entry).']";Well, that's a great point, and it gets to the heart of the concept of intentional action. Just because an action doesn't involve a lot of conscious thought, doesn't mean it's not intentional. Think of it like a skilled musician playing a piece they've practiced thousands of times. They don't consciously think about every note they're playing, but it's still an intentional action because it's guided by their prior intentions and habits. But, it does raise an important question about the causal relationship between mental states and actions. Do our mental states, like desires and intentions, actually cause our actions, or is there something more to it?;That makes sense, I guess. So, you're saying that intentions are like the spark that sets the whole thing in motion? But what about when I do something without really thinking about it? Like when I'm driving on autopilot and I turn a corner without even realizing it? Is that still an intentional action?
"['\n The idea that an action is rationalized by its mental states is still very popular; much less so is the view that the only relevant states are beliefs and desires . As Bratman  argues, desires do not have the conduct-controlling and settling functions characteristic of intentions, and thus intentions seem to be better placed to be at the center of an account in which intentional actions are constituted by their causal genesis. My desire to have my teeth cleaned, when conjoined with my belief that in order to get my teeth cleaned I need to go to a dentist, will not result in my moving towards the dentist until I actually intend to go to the dentist. In fact, when Velleman comes to dub this kind of causal theory of action ”the standard story of action“, he explicitly describes the view as one in which intention plays a central role between the ”primary reason“ and the action. In the standard story, the agent’s ”desire for the end, and his belief in the action as a means … jointly cause an intention to take it, which in turn causes the corresponding movements of the agent’s body.“ .

Some philosophers, like Donald Davidson, argue that our mental states do cause our actions, while others, like Chisholm, argue that there's a more fundamental, irreducible aspect to agency that can't be reduced to simple causal relationships. And then there are those who argue that intentional explanations are more teleological, meaning they focus on the purpose or goal of the action, rather than just the antecedent causes. It's a complex issue, but one way to think about it is to consider counterfactuals. For example, imagine you're at a restaurant and you order asparagus. Did you order it because it was delicious, or because it's healthy? Perhaps it's a combination of both, but the counterfactuals – like what you would have done if it were only delicious, but not healthy – can help us understand the teleological structure of your intentional action.;I'm not sure. I mean, it seems like our mental states do play a role, but maybe it's not the whole story. Maybe our actions are actually the result of a combination of things, like our desires, intentions, and the situation we're in.
"['\n Whereas the central notion in Davidson’s theory of intentional action was that of causation, the central one in Anscombe’s is that of practical knowledge. In a famous passage, she appears to define intentional action as an event that manifests practical knowledge:\n here (a) the description of an event is of a type to be formally the description of an executed intention (b) the event is actually the execution of an intention (by our criteria) then the account given by Aquinas of the nature of practical knowledge holds: Practical knowledge is ‘the cause of what it understands’, unlike ‘speculative’ knowledge, which ‘is derived from the objects known’. \n\n Only recently practical knowledge has received sustained interest in philosophy of action. Much of the resulting work aims to clarify and defend Anscombe’s view ; but several critics question her arguments, as well as application of the notion to the definition of intentional action . In response, a number of scholars who still find inspiration in Anscombe have sought to accommodate the criticisms by giving up on some of her most ambitious claims. This section concentrates on contemporary debates about practical knowledge stemming from Anscombe’s discussion, but we start by briefly examining its origins in ancient Greek and mediaeval philosophy.']";That's an interesting point. It sounds like you're touching on the distinction between intentional action and mere movement. Think of it like this - imagine you're playing a game of pool. As you move your cue stick to strike the ball, your hands are physically moving, but there's also a sense in which you're intentionally making a shot. Now, suppose your cue stick slipped and hit the ball accidentally - in that case, there was still physical movement, but it wasn't an intentional action. So the question is, what's the difference between these two scenarios?;"Professor Phil, I had a weird realization the other day. I was making breakfast and I had to move a plate that was in my way. But then it hit me - as I was moving the plate, did I actually ""decide"" to do that, or was my hand just moving on autopilot?"

This gets back to the idea of causation versus what's sometimes called ""practical knowledge"". Think of it like a chef who knows how to chop an onion. They don't necessarily think about each individual movement they're making with the knife - they just do it, out of habit and practice. And yet, they're still intentionally chopping the onion, even if they're not consciously thinking about each movement. So the question is, what's the nature of this practical knowledge, and how does it relate to intentional action?";But isn't the movement itself the same, whether it's intentional or not? I mean, my brain sent a signal to my hand to move the plate, either way.

This gets to the idea that intentional action can be developed through practice and habituation. As you learn to ride a bike, you start out with a kind of ""speculative"" knowledge - you have to think about each individual movement and how it fits into the larger action of riding. But as you get more practiced, that knowledge becomes more ""practical"" - you can do it without thinking about it, and yet you're still intentionally riding the bike. This is some of what Aquinas meant by ""practical knowledge being the cause of what it understands"" - in other words, when you have practical knowledge, you're able to cause certain actions to happen, even if you're not consciously thinking about them.";That makes sense, I think. But what about when I'm learning something new, like riding a bike? At first, I have to think about each movement, but then it becomes automatic.
"['\n Anscombe presents several arguments for the claim that to act intentionally an agent must know what she is doing (call this the ”knowledge condition’), and further arguments have been presented in the literature. This section surveys four influential arguments.\n One argument has already been mentioned: If a person is asked, “Why are you φ-ing?” and she (sincerely) replies, “I didn’t realize I was φ-ing” then she wasn’t φ-ing intentionally. It would seem to follow that a person must know what she is doing if acting intentionally. However, this argument is unsound. First, the expression “I didn’t realize…” is colloquially used to express complete lack of awareness, rather than mere ignorance . At most, then, the argument would show that the action cannot be completely beyond the agent’s purview. Second, even if the person’s state is in fact knowledge after the question is asked, this may be a conversational effect: By asking “Why are you φ-ing?”, the speaker intimates that the agent is φ-ing. This puts the agent in a position to know this, but not in a way that is tied to her agency.\n A more promising argument, suggested by Anscombe and endorsed by some of her followers in some form , appeals to the connection between action and assertion. It can be stated thus:\n Premise 2 is the standard claim that knowledge is the norm of assertion . Premise 1 may also look innocuous; but, as we shall see, there may be cases that speak against it.\n There are two more influential arguments inspired by Anscombe that have been used to defend the connection with knowledge. The first begins with the observation that a process in progress bears a non-accidental connection to its completion . If a house is burning, it would not be an accident if it is burnt later; and if you are writing a letter, it won’t be an accident if it is written later. What distinguishes intentional action is that the non-accidental connection obtains in virtue of the agent’s representation—her intention—to act in some way. That the agent is writing a letter—even while she takes a break, cooks a snack, and goes to the bathroom—is true precisely because she represents herself as writing a letter, and this representation guides her proceedings. Intentions, in other words ground what Falvey  calls the “openness of the progressive”: the fact that “a person may be doing something, in a suitably broad sense, when at the moment she is not doing anything, in a more narrow sense, that is for the sake of what she is doing in the broad sense” (p.22). Suppose, then, that an agent is intentionally φ-ing. Then it is true that she represents herself as doing so, the representation is true, and non-accidentally so. It is a short step to the conclusion that she knows that she is φ-ing.\n The final argument is based on the claim that intentional action is action for a reason . An agent must therefore be in a position to give an answer fitting the schema:\n Now, Thompson  has argued that the most basic way of filling this schema is one where actions themselves occupy the ψ-position (i.e. where actions are given as reasons).

"['\n The knowledge condition remains a controversial thesis in philosophy of action; but even those who reject it tend to hold that the connection between intentional action and knowledge is not accidental. Thus, there is a growing literature that aims to capture an important connection between knowledge and intentional action in weaker terms. These views can be categorized according to the term for which they recommend modification, whether (i) the practical state, (ii) the epistemic state, or (iii) the nature of the connection between them. (Naturally, since these are all compatible, some scholars recommend more than one revision.)\n Though regarded as Anscombe’s central opponent, Davidson himself recommended a version of (i). According to him, although agents need not know what they are doing under every description under which they act intentionally, they must know what they are doing under at least one description under which the action is intentional . The carbon copier, for instance, may not know that he is making 10 carbon copies, but he would have to know that he is making carbon copies, or that he is moving his hands, etc. Arguably, the idea that practical knowledge is restricted to knowledge of actions in progress is also a weakening of the thesis, since Anscombe appears to include also knowledge of future actions (§§51–2) and of completed actions such as the knowledge that I wrote my name on the board (§48) or even of what is written (§19).

However, it is not clear that such retreats help avoid the general problem, and restricting the thesis to more immediate occurrences—basic actions, intentions, or attempts—risks losing on the aforementioned feature that makes Anscombe’s view so interesting: the idea that we might bear the same intimate epistemic connection to something external as we bear to parts of our mental lives .\n Views that fall under (ii) have been influentially defended by several authors .

Not everyone agrees that knowledge is a necessary condition for intentional action, but it's certainly a popular view. To illustrate the issue, consider the following analogy: think of a jazz musician improvising on stage. The musician is acting intentionally when playing notes, but can they be said to 'know' exactly what notes they're playing in the sense that they have a conscious, explicit awareness? It's not clear. But perhaps we could say they know what they're doing in a more practical sense.;I've been thinking, Professor Phil, about how intentional actions and knowledge are connected. It seems to me that if someone is doing something on purpose, they must know what they're doing, right?
"['\n The knowledge condition remains a controversial thesis in philosophy of action; but even those who reject it tend to hold that the connection between intentional action and knowledge is not accidental.

The carbon copier case highlights the challenge of requiring knowledge under every description for intentional action. Some philosophers, like Davidson, argue that the agent only needs to know what they're doing under at least one description. So, the copier may not know they're making 10 copies, but they know they're making copies. But how do you think the scope of this practical knowledge should be defined? Should it be limited to basic actions or can it include more complex plans and intentions?;I see what you mean, but what if the musician thought they were playing one note, but actually played a slightly different one? That would be like the carbon copier example from a while back, right? If the copier thinks they're making one copy, but ends up making 10, can we really say they know what they're doing?

Some philosophers argue that a belief condition is sufficient for intentional action, rather than knowledge. But then, don't we risk losing the special epistemic connection between our minds and our actions? Think of it like this: if I'm just blindly following a recipe, do I really 'know' what I'm doing in the same way as when I'm cooking a favorite dish? The former might be more a matter of belief or habit.;I'm not sure, Professor. It seems to me that if we limit it to basic actions, we might miss something important about human agency. But if we expand it, it's hard to see how it's different from just saying the agent has a certain belief or intention.

Keep exploring and questioning – it's the best way to deepen your understanding of these issues.;That's a lot to consider, Professor. I'll have to think more about these different perspectives.
['\n What are actions? The traditional answer is: they are events of a certain sort (e.g. events with a distinctive causal history). That, at any rate, is the letter of the views found in Anscombe , Davidson , and much subsequent literature.

Yet, others take actions to be something else altogether.

It then considers further important questions about the metaphysics of action, such as whether there must be basic actions, and whether Action constitutes a unified category.'];That's an intriguing question. Let me draw an analogy for you. Think of actions like a river flow. Some might say the flow is an event, happening at a specific point in time and space – the river is flowing right now. Others might argue it's a process, unfolding over time – the river has been flowing for centuries, and it will continue to do so. This dichotomy might help us better understand the Anscombe-Davidson debate, as well as the recent scholars who argue that actions are more like processes. But what do you think? Can we meaningfully divide the river into distinct 'flow events'?;Can we consider actions as events and processes at the same time?

This is indeed an area where the process view faces challenges. Think of it like trying to identify individual waves in the ocean. Where does one wave start and another end? Perhaps we need to shift our focus from the process itself to its 'causal profile' or 'teleological orientation' – the reasons and purposes driving it. However, some scholars argue that taking actions as basic events with a causal history might provide a more straightforward approach to individuation. Do you see how this debate is connected to the broader metaphysics of action?;But if we take actions as processes, wouldn't it become challenging to individuate them? Where does one action process end and another begin?

This has practical implications for ethics and action theory. If we consider actions as a unified category, we might be more inclined to view them in terms of a general moral or rational principle. On the other hand, a non-unified view might allow for more nuanced, context-sensitive analyses of specific action types. Consider a doctor and a musician performing actions – a surgical operation and a piano recital, respectively. Do they share some fundamental 'action-ness,' or should we focus on their distinctiveness?;So, what's the significance of deciding whether actions form a unified category or not? Is it just an abstract dispute?

However, recognizing the diversity of actions doesn't necessarily undermine our grasp of agency. Consider agency as a multifaceted diamond – different facets (e.g., rational deliberation, habit, emotional responses) contribute to its brilliance, but each facet might not be reducible to a unified, essential core. A non-unified view of actions can actually enrich our understanding of human behavior, acknowledging the complexities and variability we encounter in real-life situations.;But if we allow actions to be non-unified, don't we risk losing a coherent understanding of agency and human behavior?

Each destination represents a unique goal, but one thing you're always trying to achieve, regardless of your destination, is a safe and smooth journey. In the same way, philosophers wonder if there's a common direction or aim underlying all actions, an inherent goal that ties them together, even if the specific objectives are vastly different.

Or is that simply a product of their specific goals?;I see what you mean. But isn't that just the specific objective, like getting to the grocery store safely?

Now we're venturing into the realm of agency – what it means to be an actor, to exert control over our actions. You're wondering if the underlying aim shifts depending on the circumstances or if there's something more fundamental at play. One perspective is that even though the particular goal (driving vs. walking) changes, there's still an inherent aim to achieve the desired outcome in a particular way or according to one's reasons. However, if we only focus on the change in circumstances – you wanted to drive but had to walk – it might appear as though the aim itself changes.;I'm not so sure. Maybe that fundamental aim is just a sum of all their individual goals. But what if, for example, you were forced to walk, even though you originally wanted to drive. Does that change the goal of walking?

Indeed, we might simply adjust our actions in response to changing circumstances, and that could be seen as evidence against the idea of a fundamental, constitutive aim. However, consider this: Even when adjusting to new circumstances, we tend to do so in a way that respects our existing reasons and values, such as choosing a walking route that minimizes inconvenience or aligning our actions with our long-term goals. Could that be due to an underlying aim that ties all our actions together, an aim to act according to our reasons, values, and principles?;But isn't that just us adjusting to new circumstances? That doesn't necessarily mean we're pursuing a fundamental aim. Maybe we just adjust because we have to, and that's all.
"['\n A number of challenges have been raised in the literature to the claim that there must be a constitutive aim of action. First, suppose we accept the causal theory of action: an intentional action just is the effect of a “primary reason”. On such a view, it seems that an intentional action is constituted by its causal antecedents, rather than by a necessary aim that one has in acting. However, causal theories are not incompatible with constitutivism. Since on these views, some of the causal antecedents of the action will be conative states (like an intention), the question of whether intentional action has a constitutive aim will depend on whether the conative state has a constitutive aim or whether a specific conative state must always figure on the genesis of intentional action. For instance, in Velleman’s early work , intentional action was an action that was caused by a desire for self-knowledge, and the content of such a desire was thus the constitutive aim of agency. Smith  also develops a form of constitutivism that endorses the standard story of action.\n Setiya raises a couple of important challenges to the idea that action has a constitutive aim. According to Setiya , any theory of action needs to account for the fact that practical knowledge (or a belief condition in his version; see section 4 of this entry) is essential to intentional action. However, the belief condition seems to be conceptually independent of any constitutive aim of action, and thus accepting that both are constitutive of intentional action amounts to postulating an unexplained necessary connection.\n Secondly, Setiya  relies on the distinction between an explanatory reason and a normative reason to argue against the “guise of the good” ; his argument there could be extended to other proposals for the constitutive aim of action. An intentional action is an action done for an explanatory reason, namely, a reason that explains why the agent acted as she did, in Anscombe’s special sense of the question ‘Why’. However, Setiya points out that an explanatory reason need not be a normative reason; in fact, any reason that the agent believes to be her reason to act can be an explanatory reason, even if the object of such a reason is not good in any way. But since the reasons that explain intentional action need not be good in any way, it seems false that the agent must act only on reasons that she regards to be good in some way, and thus that she aims at the good in acting.\n Philosophers have tried to answer these challenges. One can argue that a knowledge or belief condition, to the extent that it is valid, is explained by the constitutive aim of action. Moreover, perhaps the possibility of a third-person explanation of an action in terms of explanatory reasons whose objects are not good in any way is compatible with the fact that from the first-person point of view, these objects must have been regarded to be good in some way. So even if the fact that Rugen kills his father explains why Inigo Montoya killed Rugen without providing a normative reason for it, it still might be the case that avenging his father must have appeared good to Inigo Montoya in some way if he killed Rugen intentionally .\n Another well-known challenge to the idea that actions have a constitutive aim is David Enoch’s “schmagency” objection ; in this context, the objection raises the possibility that for any purported constitutive aim, one could spurn such an aim and merely “schmact” or be a mere “schmagent”—someone who behaves just like an agent except for having the constitutive aim of agency. Enoch’s objection, however, is specifically concerned with attempts to derive normative consequences from the constitutive aim of action .']";Well, let's think about it this way: imagine you're playing a game of chess. What's the point of making a move? Is it just to move a piece around, or is it to checkmate your opponent? In other words, is there an inherent goal or aim that defines the action of making a move? The constitutive aim of action is like the checkmate – it's what makes the action intentional.;Professor, I've been thinking about the nature of intentional action, and I'm not sure I understand why we need to assume that there's a constitutive aim of action in the first place.

An intentional action is an action done for an explanatory reason, namely, a reason that explains why the agent acted as she did, in Anscombe’s special sense of the question ‘Why’. However, Setiya points out that an explanatory reason need not be a normative reason; in fact, any reason that the agent believes to be her reason to act can be an explanatory reason, even if the object of such a reason is not good in any way. But since the reasons that explain intentional action need not be good in any way, it seems false that the agent must act only on reasons that she regards to be good in some way, and thus that she aims at the good in acting.\n Philosophers have tried to answer these challenges. One can argue that a knowledge or belief condition, to the extent that it is valid, is explained by the constitutive aim of action. Moreover, perhaps the possibility of a third-person explanation of an action in terms of explanatory reasons whose objects are not good in any way is compatible with the fact that from the first-person point of view, these objects must have been regarded to be good in some way. So even if the fact that Rugen kills his father explains why Inigo Montoya killed Rugen without providing a normative reason for it, it still might be the case that avenging his father must have appeared good to Inigo Montoya in some way if he killed Rugen intentionally .\n Another well-known challenge to the idea that actions have a constitutive aim is David Enoch’s “schmagency” objection ; in this context, the objection raises the possibility that for any purported constitutive aim, one could spurn such an aim and merely “schmact” or be a mere “schmagent”—someone who behaves just like an agent except for having the constitutive aim of agency. Enoch’s objection, however, is specifically concerned with attempts to derive normative consequences from the constitutive aim of action .']";Ah, great example. Now, let's consider the distinction between causal theories of action and constitutive theories. Causal theories would say that an action is intentional because it's caused by the right kinds of mental states, like desires or intentions. But even in those cases, the action still has a particular shape or direction that's determined by the mental states. It's like the pencil twirling – even if you're not consciously trying to achieve anything, the action still has a certain pattern or objective that defines it.;But what about actions that aren't goal-oriented, like daydreaming or absent-mindedly twirling a pencil? Do those actions have a constitutive aim?
"['\n A number of challenges have been raised in the literature to the claim that there must be a constitutive aim of action. First, suppose we accept the causal theory of action: an intentional action just is the effect of a “primary reason”. On such a view, it seems that an intentional action is constituted by its causal antecedents, rather than by a necessary aim that one has in acting. However, causal theories are not incompatible with constitutivism. Since on these views, some of the causal antecedents of the action will be conative states (like an intention), the question of whether intentional action has a constitutive aim will depend on whether the conative state has a constitutive aim or whether a specific conative state must always figure on the genesis of intentional action. For instance, in Velleman’s early work , intentional action was an action that was caused by a desire for self-knowledge, and the content of such a desire was thus the constitutive aim of agency. Smith  also develops a form of constitutivism that endorses the standard story of action.\n Setiya raises a couple of important challenges to the idea that action has a constitutive aim.

One way to respond is to say that even if the reason for the action isn't normative, it still reflects the agent's own valuation or motivation in some way. Think of it like a ""first-person"" versus ""third-person"" distinction. From the outside, we might explain the action in terms of causal factors, but from the agent's own perspective, they still saw the action as having some value or point. The challenge is to reconcile those two perspectives.";That makes sense, I think. But what about the challenge that an intentional action can be explained by reasons that aren't normative reasons? For example, I might kill someone because I was taught to, even if I don't think it's good or just. Does that undermine the idea of a constitutive aim?

The aim isn't meant to be a motivational or normative principle that guides the agent's behavior. Rather, it's more like a structural feature of intentional action – something that makes the action what it is. Even if we could imagine a ""schmagent"" who behaves like an agent without the constitutive aim, that would just show that the schmagent is not actually an agent in the full sense.";"Okay, I see what you mean. But what about David Enoch's ""schmagency"" objection – that we could just imagine an agent without any constitutive aim, but still behaving in the same way?"

Think of it like this: imagine you're at a restaurant, and you choose not to order the soup. Now, in one sense, you've made a choice by not ordering the soup, but in another sense, the choice was actually to order something else or not to order anything at all. It's almost as if choosing not to do something is the absence of a choice to do that particular thing.;Professor Phil, I was thinking, if I choose not to do something, is that still a choice?

In that case, it's not just an absence of a choice, but an active decision not to do something. However, the question is, would we say that not joining the club is an action in and of itself, or is it simply the lack of an action? Let's consider an analogy: is a silence between two notes in music considered music itself, or is it just the absence of sound?;But then what about when I intentionally decide not to do something, like if I don't join a club because I don't want to? Is that still just an absence of a choice?

And this gets at the distinction philosophers make between intentional omissions and refrainings. When you intentionally decide not to do something, you're making a choice, and that choice can have consequences and implications. However, the nuance lies in whether that choice is aligned with some expectation or obligation. For instance, if you refrain from hitting someone in a fit of anger, we wouldn't say you omitted to hit them because there's no expectation that you should hit them in the first place.;I suppose so. I mean, if I actively decide not to join the club, then in a way, I'm taking a kind of action by doing so.
"['\n Suppose all the Faculty at State University are upset about the recently announced cuts, and each of them express their dissatisfaction but in different ways: Mary wears a T-shirt that says “No More Cuts”, Terry writes a letter to the local paper, and Larry simply decides not to go to the department’s holiday party. It seems that in all these cases, the Faculty members are manifesting their agency—they are all equally expressing their dissatisfaction with the cuts—even if Larry does so by (intentionally) not doing something.

Think of a person choosing not to attend a meeting as a form of protest. On the surface, it might not seem like they're doing much of anything. But, in reality, they're utilizing their agency to express discontent.;Professor Phil, I've been thinking about how people express dissatisfaction.

Imagine this: you're attending a friend's wedding, and a toast is made in honor of someone you don't get along with. Instead of clapping or standing up, you decide to sit quietly and not react. In this case, your inaction communicates your disapproval just as effectively as an explicit action might.;But isn't that the same as actually doing something? Like, a form of action?

Ryle suggests we should reframe these negative instances – like not clapping or not driving a car – as 'lines of action.' That is, patterns of behavior that reflect our exercised agency without reducing them to discrete actions. Alvarez approaches the issue from a different angle, suggesting our ability to act is not just about doing but also about choosing not to do.;I see what you mean. But if you look at it that way, doesn't that turn nearly everything we don't do into some form of action? It starts to feel like even inaction requires us to be actively 'not doing' things.

['\n If we accept that omissions are absences, or at least that they are not events, the possibility of intentional omissions seem to present a challenge to the causal theory of action. After all, if agency can be manifested without any events being present, it is difficult to see how agency can be explained in the terms of the standard story of action (that is, in terms of the causal history of the bodily movements that manifest our agency). Hornsby  argues that the failure of the standard causal theory to account for omissions is symptomatic of its more general failure to locate the agent in an account of intentional action that reduces agency to causal connections between non-agential happenings.\n There are at least two ways in which causal theorists try to answer these charges.

Another strategy to make omissions compatible with the standard causal theory is to try to show that omissions are events, while avoiding the questionable view that the omission must be identified with what the agent intentionally did at the time of the omission .'];Well, what a fascinating question. Let me put it this way: is a maestro's decision not to play a note just as much a part of the music as the notes they do play? In the context of agency, it's not immediately clear whether we can be said to have acted if nothing happens as a result of our intentional decision. The absence of action seems to be a defining characteristic of omissions. But if that's the case, we have to wonder: can we still say that we've actually done something?;Professor Phil, is it possible to intentionally do nothing?

Sartorio argues that intentional omissions are often not best explained by other events (such as the formation of an intention), but by the non-occurrence of certain events (the best explanation of why I omitted to help my friend move might be that I omitted to form the intention to help them, rather than that I did form the intention not to help them). Another strategy to make omissions compatible with the standard causal theory is to try to show that omissions are events, while avoiding the questionable view that the omission must be identified with what the agent intentionally did at the time of the omission .'];Exactly – some might argue that what makes an omission intentional is precisely that it's caused by certain facts about our desires, intentions, and so forth. On this view, just as my intention to play a note is a causal explanation for why my fingers move to press the key, so too could we say that my intention not to play a note is what leads to... well, the absence of my fingers moving. But others have pushed back against this idea, arguing that sometimes omissions can't be causally explained in the same way as actions.;But isn't it possible to causally explain what led to the decision not to play the note? You know, like saying the maestro's decision was caused by their desire for a certain type of musical effect?
['\n If we accept that omissions are absences, or at least that they are not events, the possibility of intentional omissions seem to present a challenge to the causal theory of action. After all, if agency can be manifested without any events being present, it is difficult to see how agency can be explained in the terms of the standard story of action (that is, in terms of the causal history of the bodily movements that manifest our agency). Hornsby  argues that the failure of the standard causal theory to account for omissions is symptomatic of its more general failure to locate the agent in an account of intentional action that reduces agency to causal connections between non-agential happenings.\n There are at least two ways in which causal theorists try to answer these charges. One possibility is to argue that even though intentional omissions are absences, what makes them intentional is that facts about their causal history are analogous to the facts about causal history that make ”positive actions“ instances of agency .

In cases like that, it might seem that what explains the omission isn't the occurrence of some other event or decision – but rather the non-occurrence of a particular intention or event. If that's correct, then we might not be able to safely reduce agency to causal explanations in the way that some theories of action suggest.;Like, for instance, what if I didn't help my friend move because I simply never got around to planning anything?

And I think we're only scratching the surface of these issues. But if we want to get a handle on what agency means – and what's required for intentional action – we're going to have to dig a lot deeper into these questions about omissions, causality, and who we are as agents in the world.;I see what you mean. It seems like this raises questions about what agency really means – and whether we can even locate it within a causal framework.
['Two doctrines dominate philosophical and psychological discussions of the relationship between action and space perception from the 18th to the early 20th century. The first is that the immediate objects of sight are two-dimensional manifolds of light and color, lacking perceptible extension in depth. The second is that vision must be “educated” by the sense of touch—understood as including both kinaesthesis and proprioceptive position sense—if the former is to acquire its apparent outward, three-dimensional spatial significance. The relevant learning process is associationist: normal vision results when tangible ideas of distance (derived from experiences of unimpeded movement) and solid shape (derived from experiences of contact and differential resistance) are elicited by the visible ideas of light and color with which they have been habitually associated. The widespread acceptance of both doctrines owes much to the influence of George Berkeley’s New Theory of Vision . The Berkeleyan approach looks to action in order to explain how depth is “added” to a phenomenally two-dimensional visual field. The spatial ordering of the visual field itself, however, is taken to be immediately given in experience . Starting in the 19th century, a number of theorists, including Johann Steinbuch , Hermann Lotze , Hermann von Helmholtz , Wilhelm Wundt , and Ernst Mach , argued that all abilities for visual spatial localization, including representation of up/down and left/right direction within the two-dimensional visual field, depend on motor factors, in particular, gaze-directing movements of the eye . This idea is the basis of the “local sign” doctrine, which we examine in Section 2.3.'];Ah, excellent question! You're touching on a classic problem in the philosophy of perception. Think of it like a map: the colors and light are like the symbols on a two-dimensional map, but how do we infer the actual distances and three-dimensional relationships between objects? One way to approach this is by considering the role of touch and movement. Imagine you're reaching for that ball – your brain is using the sensations from your muscles and joints to calculate the distance and trajectory.;Professor Phil, how do we really know the distance between objects? I mean, when I look at a ball, it's just a bunch of colors and light, isn't it?

The idea is that our brain is taking the visual information and associating it with tactile and kinesthetic experiences – like the feeling of moving your arm or the sensation of resistance when you touch something. This association allows us to add depth to our visual perception. It's a bit like learning to read a map: at first, the symbols mean nothing, but once you've associated them with actual experiences of navigating, the map becomes meaningful. Now, consider this: if we rely so heavily on movement and touch to perceive depth, what does that say about our understanding of space?;That makes sense, I guess. So, is it like my brain is combining different senses to figure out the world?

If our perception of space is indeed linked to our motor activities, it challenges the idea that space is an objective feature of the world, independent of our experience. Instead, it suggests that our understanding of space is deeply tied to our embodied existence. Think of it like dancing: the space around you isn't just a passive backdrop – it's something you're actively engaging with through your movements. This perspective has implications for how we think about the nature of space and our relationship to it.;Hmm... I'm not sure. Maybe that it's not just something we see, but something we actively participate in?

That's where the ""local sign"" doctrine comes in – the idea that even our visual perception of space is influenced by motor factors, like the movements of our eyes. Even when you're just looking at the ball, your eyes are making tiny movements, and those movements are helping to inform your perception of depth and spatial relationships. It's not a conscious process, of course – it's all happening beneath the surface – but it's another example of how our embodied experience shapes our understanding of the world.";That's a really cool way to think about it. But what if I'm just looking at the ball, not moving at all? Am I still perceiving depth?

"['   …I say, neither distance, nor things placed at a distance are themselves, or their ideas, truly perceived by sight…. whoever will look narrowly into his own thoughts, and examine what he means by saying, he sees this or that thing at a distance, will agree with me, that what he sees only suggests to his understanding, that after having passed a certain distance, to be measured by the motion of his body, which is perceivable by touch, he shall come to perceive such and such tangible ideas which have been usually connected with such and such visible ideas.  And later in the Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge :   …in strict truth the ideas of sight, when we apprehend by them distance and things placed at a distance, do not suggest or mark out to us things actually existing at a distance, but only admonish us what ideas of touch will be imprinted in our minds at such and such distances of time, and in consequence of such or such actions. …isible ideas are the language whereby the governing spirit … informs us what tangible ideas he is about to imprint upon us, in case we excite this or that motion in our own bodies. The view Berkeley defends in these passages has recognizable antecedents in Locke’s Essay Concerning Human Understanding . There Locke maintained that the immediate objects of sight are “flat” or lack outward depth; that sight must be coordinated with touch in order to mediate judgments concerning the disposition of objects in three-dimensional space; and that visible ideas “excite” in the mind movement-based ideas of distance through an associative process akin to that whereby words suggest their meanings: the process is   performed so constantly, and so quick, that we take that for the perception of our sensation, which is an idea formed by our judgment. \n A long line of philosophers—including Condillac , Reid , Smith , Mill , Bain , and Dewey —accepted this view of the relation between sight and touch. The second respect in which action plays a prominent role in the New Theory is teleological. Sight not only derives its three-dimensional spatial significance from bodily movement, its purpose is to help us engage in such movement adaptively:   …the proper objects of vision constitute an universal language of the Author of nature, whereby we are instructed how to regulate our actions, in order to attain those things, that are necessary to the preservation and well-being of our bodies, as also to avoid whatever may be hurtful and destructive of them. It is by their information that we are principally guided in all the transactions and concerns of life.  Although Berkeley does not explain how vision instructs us in regulating our actions, the answer is reasonably clear from the preceding account of depth perception: seeing an object or scene can elicit tangible ideas that directly motivate self-preserving action. The tactual ideas associated with a rapidly looming ball in the visual field, for example, can directly motivate the subject to shift position defensively or to catch it before being struck.  The third respect in which action is central to the New Theory is psychological. Tangible ideas of distance are elicited not only by (1) visual or “pictorial” depth cues such as object’s degree of blurriness (objects appear increasingly “confused” as they approach the observer), but also by kinaesthetic, muscular sensations resulting from (2) changes in the vergence angle of the eyes  and (3) accommodation of the lens . Like many contemporary theories of spatial vision, the Berkeleyan account thus acknowledges an important role for oculomotor factors in our perception of distance.']";Well, in a sense, yes. Our understanding of depth perception does indeed rely on a complex interplay between immediate sensual experiences – namely, sight and touch – to create a coherent picture of our surroundings. Think of it like interpreting a novel: the words on the page, in and of themselves, are flat and two-dimensional, but our mind weaves a rich narrative, imbuing them with meaning and context, to create an immersive experience. In much the same way, our brain is actively interpreting visual cues and supplementing them with tactile associations, creating an expansive understanding of the world.;Professor, doesn't the concept of depth perception necessarily imply a deference to the abstract over the immediate sensual experience?

This echoes the classic philosophical conundrum of the 'neutral monism' presented by thinkers such as Hume – where the origins and mechanisms of sensation and perception are taken to resist any simple naturalistic explanation. However, let us flip this question around: Are we assuming that certainty about our perceptions is necessarily tied to its immediacy, or its correspondence to some sort of objective reality? What if, as some have argued, we needn't overly distinguish between the ' true sensory data' and our understanding of that data? Perhaps our action-based capacity to navigate the world justifies the viability of our perception, in lieu of purely 'sensory accuracy.';But is this process not vulnerable to error? If our understanding of depth perception relies so heavily on interpretation and association, how can we be certain of its accuracy?

This introduces another crucial perspective, often called 'enkinaesthetic.' By realizing that our perception incorporates actually local movement or the possibility of movement – through our head's sensorimotor kinaesthesia – one can be led to£o converging upon more relational conceptions of depth itself. Here's a simple visual analogy: take a looking glass – static – mirror in your hand. Earth remains still under your reflection when not doing anything – but push your body forward – Thus breaking mirror-relations for depths-concept from otherwise relegated- connotations based-in-to flat paper plane concepts itself without a denomination frozen merely insist assertion on.;Navigation implies movement and change in environment. In many ways, these changes contribute to the unfolding depth in our perception. That challenges a purely sensual experience definition of depth perception as grounded on objective features.

Sight not only derives its three-dimensional spatial significance from bodily movement, its purpose is to help us engage in such movement adaptively:   …the proper objects of vision constitute an universal language of the Author of nature, whereby we are instructed how to regulate our actions, in order to attain those things, that are necessary to the preservation and well-being of our bodies, as also to avoid whatever may be hurtful and destructive of them. It is by their information that we are principally guided in all the transactions and concerns of life.  Although Berkeley does not explain how vision instructs us in regulating our actions, the answer is reasonably clear from the preceding account of depth perception: seeing an object or scene can elicit tangible ideas that directly motivate self-preserving action. The tactual ideas associated with a rapidly looming ball in the visual field, for example, can directly motivate the subject to shift position defensively or to catch it before being struck.  The third respect in which action is central to the New Theory is psychological. Tangible ideas of distance are elicited not only by (1) visual or “pictorial” depth cues such as object’s degree of blurriness (objects appear increasingly “confused” as they approach the observer), but also by kinaesthetic, muscular sensations resulting from (2) changes in the vergence angle of the eyes  and (3) accommodation of the lens . Like many contemporary theories of spatial vision, the Berkeleyan account thus acknowledges an important role for oculomotor factors in our perception of distance.']";Well, in a sense, yes. Our understanding of depth perception does indeed rely on a complex interplay between immediate sensual experiences – namely, sight and touch – to create a coherent picture of our surroundings. Think of it like interpreting a novel: the words on the page, in and of themselves, are flat and two-dimensional, but our mind weaves a rich narrative, imbuing them with meaning and context, to create an immersive experience. In much the same way, our brain is actively interpreting visual cues and supplementing them with tactile associations, creating an expansive understanding of the world.;But is this process not vulnerable to error? If our understanding of depth perception relies so heavily on interpretation and association, how can we be certain of its accuracy?
"['   …I say, neither distance, nor things placed at a distance are themselves, or their ideas, truly perceived by sight…. whoever will look narrowly into his own thoughts, and examine what he means by saying, he sees this or that thing at a distance, will agree with me, that what he sees only suggests to his understanding, that after having passed a certain distance, to be measured by the motion of his body, which is perceivable by touch, he shall come to perceive such and such tangible ideas which have been usually connected with such and such visible ideas.  And later in the Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge :   …in strict truth the ideas of sight, when we apprehend by them distance and things placed at a distance, do not suggest or mark out to us things actually existing at a distance, but only admonish us what ideas of touch will be imprinted in our minds at such and such distances of time, and in consequence of such or such actions. …isible ideas are the language whereby the governing spirit … informs us what tangible ideas he is about to imprint upon us, in case we excite this or that motion in our own bodies. The view Berkeley defends in these passages has recognizable antecedents in Locke’s Essay Concerning Human Understanding .

This echoes the classic philosophical conundrum of the 'neutral monism' presented by thinkers such as Hume – where the origins and mechanisms of sensation and perception are taken to resist any simple naturalistic explanation. However, let us flip this question around: Are we assuming that certainty about our perceptions is necessarily tied to its immediacy, or its correspondence to some sort of objective reality? What if, as some have argued, we needn't overly distinguish between the 'true sensory data' and our understanding of that data? Perhaps our action-based capacity to navigate the world justifies the viability of our perception, in lieu of purely 'sensory accuracy.';Navigation implies movement and change in environment. In many ways, these changes contribute to the unfolding depth in our perception. That challenges a purely sensual experience definition of depth perception as grounded on objective features.

This introduces another crucial perspective, often called 'enkinaesthetic.' By realizing that our perception incorporates actual local movement or the possibility of movement – through our head's sensorimotor kinaesthesia – one can be led to converging upon more relational conceptions of depth itself. Here's a simple visual analogy: take a looking glass – static – mirror in your hand. Earth remains still under your reflection when not doing anything – but push your body forward – Thus breaking mirror-relations for depths-concept from otherwise relegated connotations based-in-to flat paper plane concepts itself without a denomination frozen merely insisting on assertion objectivity.;How do philosophers make use of the insight that vision is inseparable from action?
